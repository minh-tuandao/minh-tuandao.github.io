Hi everyone,

My name is Minh Dao, currently I am a PhD candidate of PPPE program at UT Dallas with expected graduation in 2027.

I have lots of interests in a wide range of research areas in (international) political economy such as income and democracy nexus, bilateral investment treaties and foreign direct investment relationship, etc. I am also developing my quantitative skills in this PhD program with various models such as: two-way fix-effects and/or dynamic modelling, two-way fix-effects with difference-in-difference design, synthetic control method, etc.

My website includes some samples of my past projects and assignments for the current class of Fall 2025 - Methods of Data Collection and Production.
