About myself:

I am currently a PhD candidate in Public Policy and Political Economy program at the University of Texas at Dallas with a focus on quantitative methodology, in particular I am also interested in pursuing a minor in Geographic Information Systems program as an extended methodological tools for policy analysis.

My research topics include the political economy of foreign direct investment, investment and/or trade agreements among countries. Moreover, I am also keen on improving/developing my methodological skills by learning from great examples of some of the general political economy or economic debates such as income - democracy nexus, Basque's terrorism impact on GDP per capita, etc.
