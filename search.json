    "text": "In the famous paper about “Income and Democracy”, Acemoglu et al (2008) (henceforth, “AJRY”) criticized the modernization theory and proved that spurious relationship between income and democracy “disappears” when we control for country-specific factors and time effects. While there are some later papers confirming AJRY’s robust results, Cervelleti et al suggests there may be a significant heterogeneous income effect: positive income effect for former colonies and negative for non-colonies sub-group. My approach is to re-examine the robustness results of AJRY and Cervelleti et al (2014) at the same time with regards to (1) different dataset, (2) wider time interval, (3) different time frequency, (4) different measurement of democracy index, and (5) sub-samples. My result confirms AJRY robust results and possibly questions the significant heterogeneous effects of income in sub-samples by Cervelleti et (2014)."

    "text": "Estimation results: pooled OLS vs. two-way FE\nIn Table 3, let us interpret the coefficients (level-log interpretation).\nFor both pooled OLS model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.008 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this is effect is statistically signification (p&lt;0.01).\nFor both two-way fix-effects model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.0005 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this effect is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).\nWe should note that we are talking about a 0-1 scale democracy index, the value seems small but is considerable: for pooled OLS model, a 100% increase in GDP per capita will result in 0.8 point increase!\nAs the Table 3 shows, the pooled OLS shows statistically significant coefficient of GDP per capita, this effect loses much of its significance when we control for country fix-effects and time fix-effects. In particular, the coefficients of both two-way fix-effects model are still statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), their effects are substantively weak (close to zero). By comparing two index of democracy, we can hardly see any substantive and significant effect of income - this is as we expected.\n\nThe AJRY’s result is definitely: (i) robust to the change in frequency of data points, (ii) robust to different measurement of the democracy index, (iii) robust to the change of a whole new data source of GDP per capita, and (iv) robust to the wider time range (1960-2021). This confirms the external validity of AJRY’s paper."

However, we can see that the substantive effect is still low. For non-colonies sub-sample, the effect of GDP per capita is “negative” but we do not have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of null effect (i.e., their 95% confidence interval includes zero). With this evidence, we can conclude that AJRY’s result is still robust in the sub-group based on colonial experience. While Cervellati and collegues suggests there may be significant heterogeneous effects: positive income effect in former colonies and negative income effect in the non-colonies sample (Cervellati et al. 2014), our results prove that there is no strong evidence of heterogeneous effect of income in sub-samples. This result can be attributed to our annual frequency and different source of dataset and wider time interval (1960-2021), compared to Cervellati et al’s, this may raise the question of external validity of their finding."

For my interest, I will replicate only this part and exclude model 6.\nLet’s plot the result of first stage. Note that, DV now is lag of log Income/capita (t-1), IV is the saving rate lagged by (t-2) or (t-3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see our instrumental variable saving rate is strongly correlated with the income.

Moreover, labor share effect is also possibly null: the exclusion restriction may be upheld (i.e., “labor share” - a channel of saving rate - predicts “income” but not “democracy”). While we have never been able to “list out” every possible underlying channel, the authors tried their best to prove that income does not predict democracy at all."
