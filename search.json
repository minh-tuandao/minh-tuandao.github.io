    "section": "I. Introduction",
    "text": "I. Introduction\nIn the famous paper “Income and Democracy”, Acemoglu and colleagues (2008) tried to prove the spurious causal relationship touted by modernization theory: income causes democracy. Instead, if we control for both unit and time fix-effects, that spurious relationship no longer holds. While their paper utilized instrumental variable: saving rate and trade-weighted democracy, that part may be an additional proof for confidence in the null-finding results. I will focus mostly on the fix-effect models.\nIn this paper, here are the following work I will take:\n(1) I will build a whole new dataset with indicators of GDP per capita (World Bank 2023), and the democracy index (i.e., liberal/democracy index “v2x_libdem”, and electoral index “v2x_polyarchy”) is taken from Varieties of democracy project (Michael Coppedge et al. 2023).\n(2) I also include AJRY’s classification for countries with colony status in the 500-year dataset to check whether there is heterogeneous “effect” of income on democracy in the colony subset.\n(3) I focus on the annual data rather than five-year interval data as the original paper did, and I reuse their dynamic model specification (from now on, “AJRY’s model” for brevity): including the lagged term for both democracy and income.\nIn other words, I will replicate their work in (i) a completely new dataset and a longer period from 1960 to 2022 (compared with 1960-2000 in the original paper), (ii) change the measurement of democracy rating by two popular indexes of V-dem project: Liberal democracy & Electoral democracy, and (iii) check for any heterogeneous effect of income on democracy within the sub-group of colony or non-colony (as defined in the 500-year regression part), this is never addressed in the original paper.\nThis replication may be meaningful for several reasons. First, we can test the robustness of AJRY’s conclusion about the relationship between income and democracy (Lipset’s law) with a whole different dataset and a new measurement of democracy index (World Bank 2023; Michael Coppedge et al. 2023). Second, most of AJRY’s model specifications make use of five-year interval while I focus on annual dataset. Third, there is a possibility of heterogeneous effect of income depending on the sub-group: countries that were former colonies and countries that were not, this aspect is not addressed in the original AJRY’s paper but is suggested by later academicians (Cervellati et al. 2014).\nThis paper is divided into the following sections. The second part is literature review, the third part states the research question and hypothesis, the fourth part will describe our data, the fifth part clarifies about the model specification and data collection, the six part focuses on the estimated results and discussion, and finally the seventh part is our conclusion."

    "section": "II. Literature review",
    "text": "II. Literature review\nModernization theory, mostly based on Lipset’s observation of economic development and democracy, tries to explain the strong correlation over the year between income and democracy (Lipset 1959). However, the seminal paper by AJRY (2008) cast doubt on such spurious causal relationship: income leads to democracy by proving that once we account for unobservable and observable country factors and time effects, that “causal” relationship is gone (Acemoglu et al. 2008). In other words, the more concrete question to ask is whether each individual countries observed over time will be more democratic - that is the intuition behind the “within estimator” for two-way fix-effects model.\nAJRY results are convincingly robust for different estimation strategies and data source (Cervellati et al. 2014). There are also critics of AJRY’s and they do find results supporting Lipset’s law by employing the same/different dataset with different estimation technique (Che et al. 2013; Benhabib, Corvalan, and Spiegel 2011; Boix 2011). In fact, the income-democracy nexus debate still has not had a conclusive answer (Broderstad 2018)."

    "text": "III. Research question and hypothesis\nResearch question can be stated as: “Does income affect democracy?”. We then can formulate the hypothesis as:\n\\(H_{0}:\\) GDP per capita (proxy for income) has no effect on the democracy index,\n\\(H_{1}:\\) GDP per capita has an effect on the democracy index.\n\nIn this paper, my expectation is that we see null effect of income, just like AJRY’s results. The causal path from income to democratization involves a lot of “unobservable” processes (e.g., culture, norms, etc.), generally dubbed “country-specific factors”. Just by increasing income and the observed correlated higher democracy qualifying for a causation is an over-generalization."

    "section": "IV. Descriptive statistics",
    "text": "IV. Descriptive statistics\nLet’s look at our data:\nAs we can see in Table 1, we have 164 countries in the dataset from 1960 to 2021, with the average GDP per capita worldwide of $7109 (current price, (World Bank 2023)).\nThe average democracy rating index is 0.3 and 0.4 worldwide 1960-2021 on the scale of 0 (lowest democracy) to 1 (highest democracy). The highest democratic rate ever recorded is 0.9 with regard to both liberal and electoral democracy index.\nIn this dataset, around 60% of the sample (excluding countries with no “colony” classification according to AJRY’s model) has a history of being a former colony in the period of 1500-2021.\nThere is nothing abnormal about data (e.g. “negative values”).\nTable 2 shows the value of log of gdp per capita: we know that the range of this variable varies wildly from country to country, it is therefore better to standardize by using logarithm formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from a simple plot showing the relationship between two sub-types of democracy index, there is a strong tendency: the more income, the better democracy one’s country becomes. Let’s see how the democracy changes over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a clear tendency that from 1960 to 2021, we see a progress of “better” democracy over time.\nJust by looking at these graphs above, it is easy to see that modernization makes sense: the richer gets to become more democratic. However, we should control for year fix-effect and (unobservable) country fix-effect to actually obtain the causal estimate of how income affects democracy. In reality, the spurious relationship shown in the graphs disappear when we control for unit and time fix-effects. This effect is robust and has been replicated by many other papers with different estimate techniques (e.g., instrumental variables method) and different datasets (Acemoglu et al. 2008; Cervellati et al. 2014)."

Model specification and data collection\nI will use the AJRY’s dynamic model specification.\n(a) Dependent variable is the democracy index, which is the liberal democracy index (main) and electoral democracy index (for comparison) taken from the Varieties of Democracy Institute (Michael Coppedge et al. 2023).\n(b) Indepedent variable is the GDP per capita. I use the World Development Indicators by World Bank (World Bank 2023).\n(c) Lagged indepdent variables are the lagged democracy index at \\(t-5\\) and the lagged GDP per capita at \\(t-5\\). In the original AJRY’s specification, they used both lagged terms at \\(t-1\\) for 5-year interval data, thus I change the lagged terms at \\(t-5\\) for annual data.\n(d) The sample will include full sample, sample with only former colonies, and sample with only non-colonies. colony status will be classified truthfully to the AJRY’s original data.\n\nFor the detailed methodologies and the proof of fix-effects formula, please consult the original paper AJRY (2008).\n\nWhile we know that fix-effects model works best with the assumption of time-invariant factors in the error term, the unobservable time-varying and heterogeneity of country-specific factors may bias the fix-effects estimation. We know there may be limitation in this method, also addressed in AJRY original paper, our main goal here is to test the robustness of AJRY’s two-way fix-effects model as AJRY did, in fact, address this by instrumental variable approach and obtained a solid null effect.\n\nNow I will use the plm package in R to conduct both pooled OLS and two-way fixed-effects models with the above specification."

Results\n\nEstimation results: pooled OLS vs. two-way FE\nIn Table 3, let us interpret the coefficients (level-log interpretation).\nFor both pooled OLS model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.008 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this is effect is statistically signification (p&lt;0.01).\nFor both two-way fix-effects model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.0005 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this effect is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).\nWe should note that we are talking about a 0-1 scale democracy index, the value seems small but is considerable: for pooled OLS model, a 100% increase in GDP per capita will result in 0.8 point increase!\nAs the Table 3 shows, the pooled OLS shows statistically significant coefficient of GDP per capita, this effect loses much of its significance when we control for country fix-effects and time fix-effects. In particular, the coefficients of both two-way fix-effects model are still statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), their effects are substantively weak (close to zero). By comparing two index of democracy, we can hardly see any substantive and significant effect of income - this is as we expected.\n\nThe AJRY’s result is definitely: (i) robust to the change in frequency of data points, (ii) robust to different measurement of the democracy index, (iii) robust to the change of a whole new data source of GDP per capita, and (iv) robust to the wider time range (1960-2021). This confirms the external validity of AJRY’s paper.\n\n\n\nEstimation results in the sub-samples based on past colonial experiences\nFor former colonies sub-sample, as the Table 4 shows, the effect of GDP per capita is positive (and significant only for liberal democracy index, not for electoral measure). However, we can see that the substantive effect is still low.\nFor non-colonies sub-sample, the effect of GDP per capita is “negative” but we do not have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of null effect (i.e., their 95% confidence interval includes zero).  With this evidence, we can conclude that AJRY’s result is still robust in the sub-group based on colonial experience. While Cervellati and collegues suggests there may be significant heterogeneous effects: positive income effect in former colonies and negative income effect in the non-colonies sample (Cervellati et al. 2014), our results prove that there is no strong evidence of heterogeneous effect of income in sub-samples. This result can be attributed to our annual frequency and different source of dataset and wider time interval (1960-2021), compared to Cervellati et al’s, this may raise the question of external validity of their finding."

From Model 4 to 9, Acemoglu et al (2008) used instrumental variable with two-way fixed effects. For my interest, I will replicate only this part and exclude model 6.\nLet’s plot the result of first stage. Note that, DV now is lag of log Income/capita (t-1), IV is the saving rate lagged by (t-2) or (t-3).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see our instrumental variable saving rate is strongly correlated with the income. The authors proposed one possible channel (i.e., labor share): labor share also correlates strongly with income.\nAnd, the second stage:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do see that the income effect is predicted around 0. Moreover, labor share effect is also possibly null: the exclusion restriction may be upheld (i.e., “labor share” - a channel of saving rate - predicts “income” but not “democracy”). While we have never been able to “list out” every possible underlying channel, the authors tried their best to prove that income does not predict democracy at all."

We know that IV method is inefficient and the standard error is wide.
