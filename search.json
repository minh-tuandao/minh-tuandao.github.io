    "text": "In the famous paper about “Income and Democracy”, Acemoglu et al (2008) (henceforth, “AJRY”) criticized the modernization theory and proved that spurious relationship between income and democracy “disappears” when we control for country-specific factors and time effects. While there are some later papers confirming AJRY’s robust results, Cervelleti et al suggests there may be a significant heterogeneous income effect: positive income effect for former colonies and negative for non-colonies sub-group. My approach is to re-examine the robustness results of AJRY and Cervelleti et al (2014) at the same time with regards to (1) different dataset, (2) wider time interval, (3) different time frequency, (4) different measurement of democracy index, and (5) sub-samples. My result confirms AJRY robust results and possibly questions the significant heterogeneous effects of income in sub-samples by Cervelleti et (2014)."

    "text": "Estimation results: pooled OLS vs. two-way FE\nIn Table 3, let us interpret the coefficients (level-log interpretation).\nFor both pooled OLS model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.008 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this is effect is statistically signification (p&lt;0.01).\nFor both two-way fix-effects model, a 1% increase in GDP per capita results in approximately 0.0005 point increase in both democracy index on average and ceteris paribus, and this effect is statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).\nWe should note that we are talking about a 0-1 scale democracy index, the value seems small but is considerable: for pooled OLS model, a 100% increase in GDP per capita will result in 0.8 point increase!\nAs the Table 3 shows, the pooled OLS shows statistically significant coefficient of GDP per capita, this effect loses much of its significance when we control for country fix-effects and time fix-effects. In particular, the coefficients of both two-way fix-effects model are still statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05), their effects are substantively weak (close to zero). By comparing two index of democracy, we can hardly see any substantive and significant effect of income - this is as we expected.\n\nThe AJRY’s result is definitely: (i) robust to the change in frequency of data points, (ii) robust to different measurement of the democracy index, (iii) robust to the change of a whole new data source of GDP per capita, and (iv) robust to the wider time range (1960-2021). This confirms the external validity of AJRY’s paper."

However, we can see that the substantive effect is still low. For non-colonies sub-sample, the effect of GDP per capita is “negative” but we do not have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis of null effect (i.e., their 95% confidence interval includes zero). With this evidence, we can conclude that AJRY’s result is still robust in the sub-group based on colonial experience. While Cervellati and collegues suggests there may be significant heterogeneous effects: positive income effect in former colonies and negative income effect in the non-colonies sample (Cervellati et al. 2014), our results prove that there is no strong evidence of heterogeneous effect of income in sub-samples. This result can be attributed to our annual frequency and different source of dataset and wider time interval (1960-2021), compared to Cervellati et al’s, this may raise the question of external validity of their finding."

For my interest, I will replicate only this part and exclude model 6.\nLet’s plot the result of first stage.

    "text": "Summit Data: President Biden - President Xi\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Biden–Xi summit generated mostly informational tweets, as shown by the frequency plot dominated by basic terms like “biden,” “xi,” “summit,” and “virtual,” with China-related words appearing prominently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hashtag network shows two main themes: one focused on U.S.–China relations (#china, #americans, #fentanyl, #coronavirus) and another on human rights (#uyghurs, #tibetans, #humanrights).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe user network reveals several small, separate clusters—journalists, policy analysts, and even NBA-related accounts—indicating that discussion was fragmented rather than centered on a single influential group.\nOverall, the summit sparked multiple parallel conversations rather than a unified or highly polarized debate.\n\n\nUS Presidential Inaugural Speeches\nWe will analyze total 60 inaugural speeches from 1789 - 2005 of 36 unique U.S. Presidents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross more than two centuries of inaugural addresses, several consistent linguistic patterns emerge. The relative-frequency plot of the term “American” shows that while most presidents use the term sparingly, some modern presidents—especially Clinton and Trump—use it more frequently when normalized by speech length, suggesting a rhetorical shift toward more explicit national identity framing in contemporary inaugurals. \n\n\n\nTop 10 Terms\n\n\nThe top-term comparisons for recent presidents highlight both common themes and individual emphases: Biden and Obama frequently invoke concepts such as “freedom,” “democracy,” and “people,” whereas Bush and Trump show a stronger emphasis on “America,” “nation,” and “great.” These differences reveal variation in tone and messaging even within the same historical era.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the overall word cloud summarizing the full set of 60 speeches shows enduring thematic anchors of presidential rhetoric—terms like government, people, states, country, great, and may dominate—reflecting long-standing concerns with governance, national unity, and civic duty. Together, these visualizations illustrate both the continuity of presidential messaging over time and the distinctive rhetorical signatures of individual presidents.\n\n\nWhat is “Wordfish?”\nWordfish is a tool that helps us understand how texts differ from one another by placing them on a single underlying scale. Instead of telling the model what “left,” “right,” or any other dimension means, Wordfish simply looks at how often certain words are used in each document and figures out which texts tend to sound similar or different. Documents that rely on similar vocabulary end up close together on this scale, while those that use distinct language are placed farther apart. In other words, wordfish is an unsupervised method.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier presidents, especially Eisenhower (1953, 1957), Kennedy (1961), Johnson, and Nixon (1973–1969,) cluster toward the lower end of the scale. This suggests that mid-20th-century inaugurals shared a more similar rhetorical style, likely shaped by Cold War themes, formal institutional language, and a more standardized presidential voice. Speeches from the 1980s onward shift upward, with Reagan, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and finally Biden and Trump occupying increasingly higher positions. The very high scores for Trump (2017 and 2025) and Biden (2021) reflect more distinctive modern rhetorical styles that rely on different vocabularies, emotional tones, or issue emphases compared to traditional mid-century speeches.\nOverall, the plot shows a gradual movement from older, institution-focused rhetoric toward more polarized, personalized, or contemporary styles in recent decades."
