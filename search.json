    "text": "Hi everyone,\nMy name is Minh Dao, currently I am a PhD candidate of PPPE program at UT Dallas with expected graduation in 2027.\nI have lots of interests in a wide range of research areas in (international) political economy such as income and democracy nexus, bilateral investment treaties and foreign direct investment relationship, etc. I am also developing my quantitative skills in this PhD program with various models such as: two-way fix-effects and/or dynamic modelling, two-way fix-effects with difference-in-difference design, synthetic control method, etc.\nMy website includes some samples of my past projects and assignments for the current summer class of 2023."

Moreover, I am also keen on improving/developing my methodological skills by learning from great examples of some of the general political economy or economic debates such as income - democracy nexus, Basque’s terrorism impact on GDP per capita, etc.\nMy contact via email: mtd220000@utdallas.edu or tuanminh112093@gmail.com."

    "text": "I have a vested interested in developing my methodological know-how, especially quantitative approaches. Here are some examples of my paper and past class assignments (replication) as a way of self-learning not just about the paper per se, but an attempt to learn coding about various programs such as STATA, R.\n\nMixed effects model (both random- and fixed-effects) evaluating the information processing of vulnerable groups and the outcome of adoption of health messages in COVID-19 (Dao and Lim 2022). The theoretical framework in use is based on Extended Parallel Process Model by Witte.\nTwo-way fix-effects with dynamic modeling based on income - democracy nexus with the replication of the famous Income and Democracy paper (Acemoglu et al. 2008) with (i) different dataset, (ii) time frequency from five-year to annual interval, (iii) longer time span from 1960 to 2022, (iv) checking for heterogeneous effect of income in sub-samples (countries with past 500-year colonial experience or not). Please find my replication paper here (update later).\nSynthetic control method: replication based on the famous paper on the effect of Basque’s terrorism on GDP per capita (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003) with comments from an improved synthetic control, i.e., augmented synthetic control (Ben-Michael, Feller, and Rothstein 2021).
