CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: They saw some pretty bad things.
CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: We love Trump!
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
No, they—they did an amazing job. And we have—by the way, we have the doctor—one of the great doctors was there. He worked on Corey, actually. He—was Corey, he had a hard time. Corey—Corey is special. Thank you, Doctor. Appreciate it very much. Great—great doctors, great doctors. The job they did on David Dutch and James Copenhaver was just incredible.
And as you know, they brought them back from very, very seriously wounded. They were going to be maybe not with us. There was a group of us, but they are doing really well now. They're making it. They're going to be fine. Not going to be perfect maybe, but who is—who is? As we get older, who is perfect?
But the doctors were so great. They had two great doctors also. And most of all, we lift the memory—our memory to the brave firefighter who was so cruelly taken from us, Corey Comperatore. Corey Comperatore, a very brave guy, loved by his family and his friends. He was really loved. In his last act on this earth, Corey threw himself over his wife and daughters and died shielding them from the bullets—the bullets of a very disturbed guy. Corey is a hero to all of us—to all of us.
CROWD: Corey! Corey! Corey!
TRUMP: I want to thank a friend of mine, too. I'm not going to mention his name because he's pretty well-known, and he came up to me, he said, ""Would it be okay if I presented Corey's wife and family with a check?"" And I said, ""Yeah, it would be okay with me. It's certainly okay."" And he handed me a check for $1 million, $1 million.
Think of that. Thank you, Dan. So, he was very generous. In addition, we have a GoFundMe that's—it's really been great. I think we're at $6 million mark for the—the three of them, plus some other people. So—but you know what, Corey's wife said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" Isn't that good? I know a lot of wives that would not say that.
I'm sorry. [laughs] They would not say that. But no, it's a great family. He was a great man. He was a brave man. He saw what was happening and he jumped on top and he got hit. But we will carry Corey's spirit of love and devotion and patriotism with us for all time, and we will never forget Corey or his beautiful family.
And maybe let's have a brief moment of silence in memory of Corey, great Pennsylvanian. [Trump bows head]
Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Beautiful. Beautiful. [applause] That is the most quiet I have ever heard an arena. I have never heard—you could hear a pin drop. No, it's amazing. It's a beautiful thing. In the wake of this heinous attack, we gather tonight more determined than ever.
Our resolve is unbroken, and our will is undeterred. Nothing will stop us on our mission to make America great again. Nothing's going to stop us. Our country is doing badly.
Front-row joes over here, front-row joes. Look at them. They've been to 212 events. You know, I'm pretty sure we have their vote. I'm not sure.
You can never be sure of anything. You're voting for Trump? OK. Front-row joes, they love us and we love them. Thank you very much. Thanks, everybody. But as we're fighting to bring back the American dream for you and your family, the radical left Democrat Party bosses have installed a puppet candidate to fight only for themselves.
Kamala Harris got zero votes. [crowd boos] She's totally scripted, owned, and controlled by the donors and the power brokers who created her campaign and who rip off our government and make billions and billions of dollars. They want to call them up, and they want to—they want to deal with her. And I didn't deal like that.
I never dealt like that. I didn't need the money. I said, ""No, I don't want to do that."" I told a lot of guys that I like and some guys that I don't like but very rich people, ""I just can't do that."" I can't do it. They want to do the telephone systems. They want to do lots of little things like that. ""We'd like to take over the telephone system of the United States."" ""I'm sorry, I can't do that."" But unlike her, I cannot be bought and I cannot be controlled.
I have no interest in that. My only loyalty is to you, the people. And you know that. I could have had such a nice easy life. I could be at a nice place right now relaxing, watching the waves breaking, but I'd rather be right here in Harrisburg with you—the people that built our country. You're the people that built our country.
I mean, some people don't like saying that. But you are, indeed, the people that built the country. We have—no matter where we go, we have the most incredible people. After lying to the country for years about Joe Biden's mental and physical condition, Kamala is now being given a personality makeover.
Don't forget, four weeks ago, she was like considered the worst, not smart, terrible, the worst vice president in history. He's the worst president we've ever had, but they were considered terrible. And all of a sudden, she's the new Margaret Thatcher. That wouldn't happen, right? The great Margaret Thatcher.
No, I don't think so. But you're going to—you're going to learn little things like defund the police. That doesn't work, does it? [booing] You're going to learn. Because everything about Kamala Harris rollout, it's phony and it's fake. Did you see when President Obama and Michelle called? Did you see? ""Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. Who is this?"" ""Oh, this is Michelle and Barack."" ""Oh. Oh."" So surprised to hear. They got four cameras in front. ""Oh, I'm so surprised."" It's on speakerphone. Listen, we just want to congratulate you on destroying Joe Biden—I mean, on winning the—Hey, is Joe Biden—was that the phoniest phone call you've ever seen?
CROWD: YES!
TRUMP: What don't you think, Dan? What do you think? Dan Meuser, great congressman. What do you think? Was that a phony phone call? You wouldn't do it. You wouldn't get away. In your district, you wouldn't get away with it, would you? But she's a defund-the-police radical trying to pass herself off as a tough-on-crime prosecutor. She wasn't tough on crime.
She's only tough on guys like me because they want to go after their political opponents. And we won the big case in Florida. Did you see? We won it. And he—and he had a similar case, but it was much worse, and he didn't have the Presidential Records Act. He had a similar case. And, you know, the special counsel, which is basically a special prosecutor, adjudged him to be essentially mentally incompetent, with poor memory, but a nice old guy.
He's not old. You know, 81 is not old. I have friends that are 95 that are still—Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot, 95 years old, still sharp—still sharp. I spoke to him the other day. I said, ""I think you're smarter now than you were 30 years ago."" I don't know what's going on. I said, ""What's going on, it's working for you."" Eighty-one is not old.
And—but he's different. He's a—he's a bad 81. He's a bad 81. And he's ruining—he destroyed—he's destroying our country, I'll tell you. And she's worse than he is. She is actually worse than he is because she's a real radical left. He's a phony radical left. He didn't believe this stuff. He didn't believe in open borders, and she does.
She wants to open your borders. She wants to have all-electric cars. She loves the all-electric car mandate. She destroyed San Francisco. But she's the architect of the border invasion, trying to pretend she's strong on border security. She's now pretending that she was never called the border czar. She was called the border czar the first day.
She's the border czar, and she never went. She actually went. You know, they say—they fact-check me. Anything I say is like a little—she actually went to a beautiful part of the border. I would love to take my first lady wife there to have dinner. It's beautiful, very safe. No, she didn't go to the real border, did she, front-row joe?
She went—she went to a nice little place, was there for a short period of time and left. So, she's never really been to the border, and she's the border czar. And our country is being invaded with people from prisons and people from mental institutions and terrorists. She's a failed vice president leading a failed administration while trying to convince you that she represents hope and change.
Well, she does represent change. She wants to turn us into a communist country. That's her change. [booing] She was voted the most unpopular vice president in history. That's hard for a vice president to be that unpopular, right? Just like Biden will go down as the single worst president in the history of our nation.
The happiest man is Jimmy Carter. He's an old guy right now. He's an old guy, but he's happy because his administration is considered brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this disaster that we have right now. In her speech in Atlanta last night, Kamala Harris even tried to out-brand a new Southern accent.
Did you hear her new accent? If I ever did that, all of those people back there—look at that, look at all those cameras. [booing] That's—oh, would I go through hell—I'd have a week of hell if I ever tried to do that. The contrast could not be more stark. On the one hand, you have a radical left puppet candidate who is fake, fake, fake.
And on the other hand, you have a president who will fight, fight, fight for America, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: This is a hell of a big arena. How many seats—this looks like Madison Square Garden. This is a big—this is a big, beautiful place. Wow. I didn't care. I didn't care, although they'd prefer that we be in an arena.
I don't know why. But we're not giving up the outdoor rallies. You know, all those people that we had to turn away today, at an outdoor rally, you can have—we had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey, 107,000. But, you know, in the South Bronx, we had 25,000 people. It was like a lovefest. South Bronx, tough place, but it was a lot of love.
No matter how much Kamala Harris tries to change her image, she cannot change this fact: She is the most extreme liberal candidate in the history of our country by far. She's an extreme radical left lunatic. And, you know, I've been saying for the last six months, I've been saying about politicians—because I really know politicians.
Well, I've dealt with them on both sides. And, you know, then I said, ""Let's do this, you know —"" Thank you. But when a politician comes out early on with an idea like she wants to defund the police and all these other things she wants to do, really bad things, that's where they're at. They're going to be there eventually, right?
Mike Kelly. Stand up, Mike, will you, please? This guy, he used to stand up—he's my friend. He endorsed me on day one, right? Day one, day one. He endorsed me before I was running. He said, ""That guy's got to run. I endorse him."" I didn't even run. I had—""How many endorsements do I have?"" ""Well, you got Kelly of Pennsylvania."" I wasn't running.
Anyway, thank you, Mike. I appreciate it. He was—he would stand out at those outdoor rallies when it was 10 degrees below zero and it was 97 degrees out, without a shirt on. It's not that pretty a sight, not that pretty, but he would have—he had no fear. He's a tough guy, and they love him. They love you in this state.
Kamala Harris co-sponsored Bernie Sanders' $32 trillion socialist takeover of the entire U.S. health core—care system. Think of this, U.S. health care, it would mean that we're going to have to raise your taxes, bankrupt our country, and she supported outlawing all of the private health insurance. A lot of people in this room have great—some people want private health.
It's—some of it is incredible. You go to these companies; they're doing an incredible job. They want to be able to—she wants that banned, and she wants that outlawed. You can't buy that anymore. You're paying for it. But it's great stuff. I mean, some of the companies have unbelievable—the golden plans and all that, and she wants it to be ended.
She pledged to give free taxpayer-funded health care to all illegal aliens. Think of that. [booing] Oh, and she'll do that, which will totally destroy our Social Security system. She sponsored a bill to give illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers so they could sue us. [booing] And she called for abolishing ICE.
These are unbelievable patriots, by the way. They're almost as tough as our congressmen sitting in the front. They're almost as tough as the man that's going to be your next governor, by the way. He's tough, too. He's tough. He's a great military hero, and he'll come up—I'm allowed to have him up for a little while, right?
Just a couple of minutes, right? He's great. He's great. And I hear you're doing very well. But you get ready. You get it ready. You got to knock them dead. She compared ICE agents to members of the KKK. She likened Border Patrol agents to practitioners of human slavery. We have a lot of those great people here tonight like Brandon Judd, the head of the union, Paul.
We have so many different people, and they didn't like that analogy too much. She voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities numerous times. She supports open borders. That's all you'd have to hear. I think two words. You know, they say, ""Sir, go down the list. We have a list of 25 things."" All you have to say is two things: open borders, defund the police.
The rest is all—but, you know—although she is going to kill Social Security because by putting all of these illegal aliens into Social Security, it's dead. It's dead. She opposes even saying the words illegal alien and radical Islamic terrorists. She backs mass amnesty, mass amnesty and citizenship for all illegals.
She supports mandatory gun confiscation. Would anybody mind—[booing] Mr. Congressman, would they mind having their guns ripped out of their arms as they enter their house or their apartment? I don't think so. I don't think. She said that 70 percent to 80 percent tax rate is ""a very bold idea, something that we have to discuss very seriously."" She likes it. And, you know, all my life, I watched politicians, and they've always said, ""We will reduce your taxes. We will reduce your taxes. We will cut your taxes."" They want to give you a tax increase of five times what you're paying now. How the hell do you get elected? This country is so screwed up. Everything's backwards. We want open border. We want taxing. How do you like to be a politician? We want open borders.
We want tax increases. We want all-electric cars so that you can go 15 minutes before you charge it up. And for all the congressmen that are here, in the Midwest, they built eight charging stations. Now, you know what that is? That's like a gas pump with electricity coming out, just a charging terminal. It cost $9 billion.
Did you hear that, Mike? Did you hear that? Scott, oh, you—I said he's another tough—we got tough congressmen here. These are—these are tough cookies, these Pennsylvania guys. Wow. Look at that. We're going to introduce them in a second. Scott. So, they spent $9 billion on eight charging stations, two of which never worked.
I don't think any of them work. She wants government intervention to slash consumption of red meat. They don't want red meat. That means they don't want your cows. Get rid of your cows. We like—does anybody—would anybody like to keep red meat? Raise your hand. [cheers and applause] You know, think of it, borders, and electric mandate and all of the things, red meat, how the hell do you get elected, right?
You know how they got elected? By cheating. They got elected by cheating because nobody—they want to raise your taxes by five times. ""Oh, please vote for me. I'm going to raise your taxes five times higher."" But the red meat is to fight climate change, OK? Climate change. She supports ending cash bail to immediately release criminals upon arrest.
They kill somebody. ""No bail? Don't worry about it. No cash. You know, you just killed three people. No, let's let them out in Harrisburg. It's a wonderful place."" And in 2020, she personally urged her followers to donate money to bail out the violent rioters, get them right out of jail, including murderers.
You know what that was all about, right? In Minnesota, which I think we have a good chance of winning. Hasn't been won since 1972 by a Republican. And we're leading. Tom Emmer is going to bring that one home. They tell me he's going to bring it home. This November, the American people are going to reject Kamala Harris' dangerous liberal extremism in a massive landslide.
We're going to too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. Too big—too big to rig. We're not going to let her turn the United States into a communist San Francisco colony. We're not going to let it happen. That's what they want to do. They want to destroy our country. She's the worst. She was a bad DA long before you had your DA, long before you had some of these DAs that you have, as you know, in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, but in Los Angeles, all over the place.
All over the place, you have bad DAs. You have radical left, horrible DAs that are funded by Soros and others, and they're weak—they're just weak on crime. They don't mind if somebody murders somebody. They don't want them to go to jail. You can kill somebody now—our country is sick. The mindset of our country is sick.
And we're not going to let her do to Pennsylvania what she did to California. She destroyed San Francisco, one of the best cities in the world, and it's in tatters. So, she's a liberal from California. She ruined the state. She ruined this great—one of the greatest cities in the world. You know, 15 years ago, a great friend of mine, Bob Tisch, great guy who's an owner of the New York Giants and a very smart guy, a wonderful guy, too.
Maybe even longer—a little longer than 15, he said San Francisco is the best city in our country. And today, it's a disaster. It's just a disaster. He passed away quite a while ago, and he would look down and say, ""What the hell happened to that city?"" But he thought San Francisco was one of the greats.
He thought Chicago was one of the greats. You know, Chicago, on July Fourth weekend, had 117 shootings and 17 people died. Think of it. This is not even believable. When you hear about Afghanistan and the horrible job that this president did with Afghanistan, a low point, but they don't have—they don't have anything like that.
In one of the most astoundingly phony moments in her speech last night, Kamala Harris bragged that ""I will proudly put my record against Donald Trump's any day of the week. I will put it against Donald Trump."" This—this—she's got one of the worst records in anywhere. Well, Kamala, let's go, challenge accepted.
Are you ready? Let's compare our record point by point. [cheers and applause]
Mike. I can't believe I'm doing it. You know, the weird thing—I mean, two weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. I didn't even know her name. Nobody did. Kamala. Hello. Beautiful. I didn't even know her name. Kamala. I heard she was a rotten border czar.
That's about all I knew about her. Her only job was the border, and she never went there. But two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it was all about Biden. Then I kept hearing they were going to steal it from him. And I said, ""You know, it's hard to do."" Because I understand, when you have the delegates—he had all the delegates.
He had 100 % of the delegates. He had 14 million votes. I said, ""You can't really do it."" But then they threatened him very strongly. They said, ""You're incompetent, and we're going to get you out."" He just won; you know. No, they happened to be right. He was incompetent, but these are minor details. No, he just won.
He had all the votes. And he could have said no, but he was afraid. And he's an angry man right now. Here's the big question I have, will he be invited to the Democrat National Convention? Will he be invited, Mr. Congressman? I don't know. Now, he will be because I'm mentioning it. If I didn't mention it, he would not be invited.
But now, they have to invite him. But you know what's crazy, the craziest thing? So, you don't mind if I go off teleprompter all the time. It's such a shame. I have these great speechwriters; they really are Ross and Vince. They're great. They're the best speechwriters. And I—you know, I hardly speak about this, but I could read the most gorgeous speech, but you may be bored to tears.
No, it's—they're beautiful. The words are beautiful. Everything's great. The sun will rise. The moon will set. The oceans will glisten. I say that's beautiful, but I'm not sure that Harrisburg wants to hear that stuff. What do you think, Congressman? What do you think, Doctor? I don't think so. No, they are great, but I tend to—I tend to go off about 75 percent of the time.
But, you know, the hard part is that three or four weeks ago, I was talking about Biden. He's incompetent. He's a horrible president. He's the worst president in the history of the country. Now, I say she's the worst vice president, which is true. She's considered the worst. She's the most unpopular vice president in the history of the country.
She did a transformation. You know the press is very corrupt. You know that. They gave her a transformation [booing] like Houdini. That was a Houdini-like—that was a magic trick. But don't worry. She's going to fall because it's not about him or her. It's about the policies. They're the same, and they're horrible, right?
But they gave her—so, you know, it's sort of like—I don't know if anybody watch UFC as an example. Do you watch it, right? Dana White, the great Dana White. Did you see him? He introduced me the other—he introduced me the other day at our convention. We had the greatest convention in the history of politics, in my opinion.
Thank you, Milwaukee and Wisconsin. And the arena was beautiful. It was an unbelievable—but Dana White introduced me. And he heads up UFC. He's done an incredible job. But it's almost like you're having a fight between two guys and one guy is getting beat up bad. Then he goes to a debate, right? The debate didn't work out too well.
How did the debate work out for him? I don't think so good, Scott. The debate didn't work out exactly good. Then he tried to recover from the debate by going out every day, and it got worse and worse. It was a basic disaster. But it's like having two fighters, and the one guy is getting beat up really badly, really—and they say, ""All right. Stop the fight. Come on out. I'll put a new one in."" That's what we have here. Kamala is the new fighter. Who cares?
Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. You know that because you didn't have people sleeping on your lawn all night. We ended catch and release. We stopped asylum, fraud, coal. We got Remain in Mexico. Remember that one? Do you think that was easy to get? I call up the president of Mexico, a friend of mine. He's a socialist, but still he was a friend of mine. He gave us many, many thousands of troops to guard our border while we were building the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then they didn't want to finish it up, which could have taken place very quickly.
But think of it. But, you know, we got Remain—think of it, Remain in Mexico. That means you can't come into our country. You have to remain in Mexico until you get approved, of which very few people got approved. Do you think that was easy? That wasn't easy. Negotiated historic Safe Third Agreements, which are complex, I won't waste your time, but they were great, with Central American nations.
Built 571 miles, think of that, of border wall. We're going to add another 200. Far more than I said I was going to build. And it was working. It was working. It was good. We had the best illegal immigration nonflow I call it. We had—they don't—they were having a hard time. Also, drugs were way down.
Human trafficking was way down. It's human trafficking and human trafficking in women mostly. You know, it sounds ancient, human trafficking. It sounds like something from a thousand years ago, but it's as big a business, in a sense, as the drug business. And the reason is because of the internet. The internet made human trafficking a very, very big and horrible business.
They traffic in women. They put them in the trunk of a car, they put them in the back seat, and they'd close it up, and you can't even breathe, and they bring them—they bring them across the border. We had knocked it down cold. And now, it's at a level five times greater than it ever was before. Nobody's there to check.
Nobody's to look at the car. Nobody knows who's there, who's in it. But you can see it on a certain chart that I have. You know, this chart saved my life. Where is that chart? [cheers and applause] I love that chart. I'm going to sleep with that chart for the rest of my life, that chart, that chart. You know the amazing thing?
You know, the people that operate the—the computers and all the brilliant equipment we have backstage. She said to me—she's great. She's great. She should come out. Just tell her to come out here for a second. Quick, quick, quick, quick. You got to get her out. She's never done this before. She saved my life, in a sense.
I said you saved my life. Here she is. Wow. Wow. [cheers and applause] Wow. Thank you. You're going to say something? You saved my life.
UNNAMED TRUMP STAFFER: Hi.
TRUMP: Thank you. No, she's a computer genius—she saved my life. No. So, you know the stories, but that chart, I only used it probably less than 20 percent of the time.
So, in other words, we do the rallies and stuff, sometimes I'll pull it down, sometimes I won't because I do things a little bit at random while I'm up here. Hello. Look at that big fella back there. But I do things a little bit at random. But two things about the chart. It's always on my left, which means I'm gone.
It's always on my left. If it was on my left, I have, Mr. Governor—Mr. Future Governor, I have no chance because it would have been perfect, perfect hit. And it's only used a little bit. And I always use it at the end of a speech. I never used it early. In fact, she was saying today, ""It was so—we were really sort of flabbergasted because you called for it at the very beginning of your speech."" And that chart, I'm so proud of it. Now, I like it much more than I liked it before.
But see the arrow on the bottom? [gestures to screen] That's the lowest level of illegal immigration in the history of our country recorded, and that was the last week of my presidency, Mike. So, that was the last week. And look what happened to our country after that. And those are now a little bit old because if you look on the right, it's a little bit old.
Those numbers are much higher. They, right now, would go off the ceiling. And that's what happened to our country in a short period of time, three and a half years. But look at that number and look at that arrow. So, anyway, much more importantly right now, I say—I'm talking about illegal immigration real quick.
I said, ""You know what, pull up the chart. Pull it up."" And they weren't ready because—but they're so good. And I said, ""Wow, that was so quick."" There's nobody over here except for this lunatic. And because the crowd was massive, as far as the eye could see, as far as—I mean, that's why I love those outdoor sites because you don't have to send 20,000 people back home.
And I hate to do that. They come out, and they want to get in, and then you get the seats. Would anybody like to give up your seat?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: I thought you were nicer people than that in Pennsylvania. Anyway, so—so I—I say chart, and I go like this, ""And the chart —"" Pew. [gestures shooting gun] So, a couple of things.
She—she told me today, she said, ""You know, the amazing thing is you always call for the chart at the end of the speech, not the beginning."" So, that was one factor that's crazy. ""It's always on your left, not your right."" It happened to be on the right this time. I don't think I've ever seen it on the right.
And various other things. And if I'm here, it's over. If I'm here, it's no good. If I'm—I had to be exactly—because he was exactly where that very beautiful woman in the white is, right? Stand up. That's exactly. And my son said that's not a long distance, 100. I don't know so much about shooting other than I'm very good for the Second Amendment, I can tell you, but I don't know so much about shooting.
But I know about sports. I know about golf. He said, ""That's like sinking a two-foot putt, Dad."" That would be the equivalent. Is that right? He actually said it might be less than that because some people can't sink a two-foot putt like Biden. I would say Biden. Biden can't sink. But—but that's like sinking—did anybody see the Bryson DeChambeau thing? Did you?
CROWD: YES!
TRUMP: That was cool. We had a good time. He's a great guy, great young athlete. So, all these things, and, you know, then you figure what are the odds that that happened, right, where you're just—you're literally exactly there. You hadn't made the full turn. But that chart will always be my world's most favorite chart for a lot of reasons.
Number one is that day in Butler, Pennsylvania, and number two is look at those numbers. That was the lowest number of illegal aliens that we've ever had. So, it really was a very important—that was a very important thing. It was done by Border Patrol. Now, let's examine the record of Border Czar Harris.
She inherited the strongest border in US history and immediately turned it into the worst border nightmare in the history of the world. There's no country in the world that's ever had a border like this. I think the real number is 20 million people, maybe more. Nobody knows. You know, you have a thing called gotaways.
We have millions of gotaways, meaning people that weren't caught. They got away. Upon taking office, Harris and Biden stopped wall construction; halted all deportations; protected sanctuary cities; ended Remain in Mexico and our asylum cooperation agreements, which are very important; and allowed a gigantic invasion of our country, bringing in millions and millions of illegal aliens at levels never seen before.
Now, actually, other than that, I thought she was doing a very good job, right? She's done a wonderful job. She's the worst ever, and she's going to be your president? You'll—she will destroy our country. This November, the American people are going to compare these records, and they're going to tell Border Czar Harris, ""You have done a horrible job. You're a disgrace to our country. You're fired. Get out of here. You're fired. Get out. Get the hell out of here."" But Kamala is protected by the fake news. [booing]
They're trying to delete everything she said. Hey, did you ever see the unselect committee? The unselect committee, on January 6th, did you see where they went and deleted and destroyed all evidence? It was deleted and destroyed.
So, I think, Dan, you, and all of my friends here, should be indicted for that. They destroyed evidence. You know why? Because the evidence showed that we were innocent. The evidence showed that Nancy Pelosi should have had protection at the Capitol that I offered her and they turned it down.
The evidence showed that all these stories were fake, including me wanting to grab a big strong Secret Service agent around the neck. Think of—think of this. Think of this. I'm in a car. I say, ""Fellas, I'd love to go down to the Capitol."" ""Sir, we don't think it's good because, you know, you're very exposed to all of that."" So, OK. I said, ""You don't think we can —"" ""No."" So, I said, ""All right. Where do you want to go?"" ""We'll go back to the White House."" That's the experience.
This one person had me getting extremely upset. I don't get upset. When somebody smart says, ""Sir, you're probably better —"" and nothing was happening, just people were walking down, remember, patriotically, right?
CROWD MEMBER: Yeah! That's right!
TRUMP: Right?
Right? So, they had me coming from the back of the car. Now, these guys are very strong. They're young and strong. Not as strong as me, but they're strong. And I grabbed the one guy driving, and he got arms—he's got arms like this. I grabbed him, and I was rebuffed. And then I went over to the right. And I think he's like a world champion karate guy, right?
Like a very tough cookie. Bobby. His name is Bobby. That's all I know, but I know him well. He's a good guy. And I grabbed him around the neck, and I began to twist and turn. And he was in tremendous pain because of the power of Trump, tremendous pain. And then I went back to the White House, and I started throwing hamburgers at the wall.
This is the story this person told. So, they went to the Secret Service, they found out it was all bullshit. [cheers and applause] Everything. All made up. It was just made up, which most people—I mean, honestly, most people would think that. You know, think of me grabbing these two strong tough guys. That's what they do. The one guy said, ""You know, if I ever—if somebody ever put their arms around me —"" He's trained automatically to go with his fingers like that. [mimes gouging eyes]
You know, it's what he's trained. Me, I like other things better personally. I'd like to run the country better. That's what I'd like to do, you know. They're good with the finger. They're good with their fingers into the eye, the fingers into the eye, and you have a tendency to immediately let go and—and—and get a towel and start crying because it hurts.
They say, ""Oh, that hurts."" No, it was all made-up stuff. You know, it was all made-up stuff. But wouldn't you think it is? I mean, who would believe Trump was so angry, he grabbed the one guy who was rebuffed, then he grab the other one around the neck? These people are sick. Who would believe it? But probably some people do, even if it's five people.
But no—but some people would believe it. You know, they hear it. They deleted everything because the stories turned out to be false. They deleted everything. Nancy Pelosi turned down 10,000 troops or National Guard. If we had 500, you wouldn't have had a problem. And what you never see is the crowd. The crowd was—it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before.
And a small portion walked peacefully and patriotically down to the Capitol. You remember the term? Peacefully and patriotically. ""He's horrible. It's insurrection."" You know, if you have an insurrection, you don't say peacefully and patriotically, right, Mike? You say let's go. No, they're—these are really bad people. These are crooked people.
And then her daughter—you saw that about a month ago. Her daughter taped her, saying that it was her fault the day—their daughter is a cinematographer. I'm sure Nancy is thrilled. They just released a tape where Nancy is saying, ""This is my fault."" This is during the thing.
Because she didn't accept my offer, she said, ""This is my fault. I could have stopped this."" Now, she's trying to say, well, she didn't really mean that. No, these are—these are bad people. They're trying to delete everything that she said over the last—think of it, this is on Kamala, it's no different, over the last 10 years that's controversial or bad.
It's like defund the police, the fact that she was given authority over the border that—you know they're trying to say that under no circumstances was she even in charge of the border. And the fake news is trying to delete everything. Are you seeing what's going on? They're trying to delete everything.
But, you know, it's a wonderful—the internet is wonderful in certain ways. We have every single copy of every article. But they're trying to delete it. Under crazy Kamala's policies—you know, when I got hit, everybody thought I was going to be a nice guy, and they thought I'd changed, remember, just before the Republican convention.
And—and nobody thought I'd be there. You know, it's not great to be there when your ear is slightly throbbing. ""Let's go to the convention, darling,"" to the first lady. ""Let's go."" But I got there. Next day, I left, right? And it was the greatest convention. But—but—and it was like a convention like no other.
It was a convention that we were all so proud of. But they all said, ""Trump is going to be a nice man now. He came close to death."" And I really agreed with that for about eight hours or so. And then I realized they were trying to put me in prison for doing absolutely nothing wrong. They went to judges who are crooked judges.
They went to judges who are fake. They had prosecutors who are Democrat radical lefts and always in areas where it's like 3 percent Republican or less. And I said, ""You know, these are bad people."" So, I was nice for about, what would you say, Dan, three, four, or five hours, and then I said, ""These are bad people. We have to win this battle."" And you know what, they're going to become nicer when we win. But we're going to have to win, I believe, to make them reasonable because they are crazy. They are crazy. [cheers and applause]
Under Kamala's policies, criminals, rapists, and vicious gang members are pouring in from South America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.
You know, an insane asylum is a step above, right? This is—oh, they go crazy when they want to try and say he's cognitively impaired. You know, I stand up here for two hours, and I speak without a mistake. But when I say Hannibal Lecter, they say, ""Why does he keep mentioning —"" because Hannibal Lecter was a serious psycho, right?
He was ""Silence of the Lambs."" Dr. Hannibal Lecter, he'd like to have you for dinner. See the man with the wall, stand up. Look at this guy. He's here so much. He's great. He's great. He's—He's a Trump voter. I don't think we have to worry about him, do we? He's a Trump voter all the way, but Hannibal Lecter would like to have you for dinner.
But these people are now in our country. And they always—you know, actually, it's quite clever, I think. But, you know, what do you do? But they're always saying like, ""He mentions Hannibal Lecter. It doesn't make sense."" No, it makes a lot of sense. They're coming into our country, and they're coming in from insane asylums, which are closing all over the world, it's not just South America, because we have the worst people representing our country.
They laugh at the stupidity of these people. All over the world, they're coming from the Congo in Africa. Twenty-two prisoners right out of prisons from the Congo in Africa. Not just South America. Meanwhile, our crime rate is going up. How about where they say, ""Our crime rate is going down."" We just had 117 people shot.
You could take just Chicago and the whole nation's crime rate. Look, these are bad people. They're phony people, they're liars, they cheat on elections, they do a lot of bad things, and we have to win this election because crime statistics are a disaster. They're made up by people that work in the White House.
And obviously, the crime is getting worse because we have probably 20 million people in our country right now. And every single day, you read about one of these horrible monsters from parts unknown who raped a young girl, killed her, cut them up, used his knives, not guns because it's a slower death. These are monsters, and we have them in our country.
And we're going to deport them at a level like nobody's ever seen. We're going to get them the hell out of our country, and they're going back to the country from which they came. Because we have become a dumping ground for the world, and we're not going to take it anymore. We're going to get rid of these liberal lunatics like Kamala.
Just yesterday, it was reported that more than 1,000 members of the savage Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua are plotting to conduct ambush attacks on police and law enforcement in the United States. All the while, Harris and Biden sit in the White House and try and figure out who's dumber. They sit in the White House.
Think of it, massive—massive numbers of Venezuelan gang members. Now, Venezuela is very smart. They sent them into our country, and then you read that crime is down 72 percent in Venezuela, which it is. On Sunday, in a separate incident, a Venezuelan illegal alien criminal let in the border by our border czar, Harris, shot a female police officer in Texas, you read about it, multiple times with a rifle.
Thankfully, the officer is perhaps going to survive. They don't know yet, but probably. But most victims are not so lucky. In Texas, last month, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was tied up, sexually assaulted, and strangled to death by two illegal aliens who Biden and Harris released into the United States.
If Border Czar Harris stays in charge, every single week, we'll bring never-ending streams of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers, and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters and our wives and our husbands. They're letting horrible people into our country. They're poisoning—they're poisoning our country.
By contrast, if I am elected, on day one, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history and we will immediately deport all of the criminals that Border Czar Harris has allowed to enter our country. They'll be deported. But no comparison of our immigration records would be complete without considering the terrorists that this crazy border czar of ours is letting into America.
By the way, can anybody imagine her as—in all fairness, we want to be politically correct and all that. Great. Who cares? Can anybody imagine her dealing with President Xi of China, who's a fierce individual, fierce person? You know, she was sent to deal with Putin to keep him from invading Ukraine, which, by the way, he would have never done if I were president.
Israel wouldn't have been attacked. He would not have attacked Ukraine. The recent hits on Israel wouldn't have taken place. We wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't have had that horrible disaster in Afghanistan. None of these things would have happened. We'd be respected again. Now, we're laughed at. All over the world, they're laughing at us. When I was president, terror watchlist encounters at the border reached—one year—and I don't believe it. It was done by Border Patrol and ICE.
They have one year where it was zero. They said—and I don't even believe that myself. But you know what, I'll take it because the charts are usually the other way. Zero. And then after—and it was part of that that we just looked at, but we had zero terrorists reported coming in in 2019. I believe the year was 2019. Zero.
So, let's say it was 10 or 20. Now, it's thousands of people coming in. I never believed the zero, but I'll tell you, we'll take it. But assuming it was 10, 15, 20, thousands and thousands of terrorists are pouring into our country. Under Kamala Harris, thousands of terrorists have been let right in—right in. And according to news reports, the Biden-Harris administration has absolutely no idea who they are or where the hell they come from.
Just come on into our country. But you're going to be finding this out. You're going to have to be thinking—you're going to have a migrant crime statistic that's going to rival anything that we've ever had. And the only thing good about these people—they're very tough people. They come out of those jails and those prisons and those mental institutions.
The only thing that is really good about them is they make our criminals look like very nice people. It's true. Our criminals that we used to fear, we don't fear anymore, Doctor. They're like nice people compared to the people that are coming into our country. No candidate who would knowingly keep the border open as terrorists pour across it can ever be trusted to be commander in chief.
You can't do it. You can't let her—you can't let it happen. If she becomes your president—and I think worse than Biden. I think worse than Biden. And he's gone. He's shot. But if she becomes your president, our country is finished, I'll tell you. And Pennsylvania, your beautiful commonwealth—it's always good when you remember it's a commonwealth.
He would call it a state often. Remember when Biden used—I used to love this guy because you were on pins and needles watching him speak. You know, when is he going to blow it? And it would always happen. Remember, he'd finished his speech and he couldn't find the stair. [turns around and raises arms] And then these handsome men would run up and grab him and help him.
And every time I imitated, the first lady tells me, ""Why—why do you keep doing that? Because they keep saying you can't find the stairs off the —"" You know, you've only got about nine stairways off the podium. But unlike Kamala Harris, I will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
We're going to keep them out. It's going to be safe. We're going to have a safe country. The fact is, four years ago, we were respected like never before. I would say like never before. We were respected by China, by Iran. Look at Iran. Iran is going wild now, aren't they? You know, Iran was broke when I was president.
They didn't have money to give to Hamas. They didn't have money to give to Hezbollah. Do you see what's going on now with Hezbollah now? You're going to end up in a world war. You're going to end up in a third world war pretty soon with this—with this guy. Between Ukraine and Russia and the stupidity with—I will get that negotiated and end it before I ever take office.
I'll do it after the election as president-elect. In addition to her atrocious record on border security, Kamala Harris would also obliterate Pennsylvania's economy. You know about that. She's against fracking. She's against oil drilling. She wants everybody to have one electric car and share it with the neighbors.
Harris has stated repeatedly that she supports banning fracking. ""I ban fracking. I will ban it on my first day."" Now, she's denying it. Remember, a politician always goes back to what their original thought was, right? And she co-sponsored the $100 trillion green new scam designed to abolish the oil, coal, and natural gas industries entirely.
We have more liquid gold under our feet than Saudi Arabia, than Russia by far. And under me, we took it—from fourth place and third place, we took it to first place by a lot. We were energy-independent, soon to be energy-dominant. We were going to make so much money, we're going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further.
Now, you can't do anything with these lunatics. Under a Harris presidency, 423,000 Pennsylvania jobs are linked to fracking, they'd all be demolished. She's against fracking. She's not going to allow you to frack. She's not going to allow you to frack. And the only reason they're allowing it now—you know, they cut it way back.
That's what caused the inflation. And then he opened it up again back to the Trump days. He opened it up to the same because it's similar because he wanted to try and get reelected. They didn't know his party was going to overthrow him. It was a coup. This was a coup of a president. He will be famous. He will be more famous for the coup than the bad job he's done, OK? But this was a coup of the president of the United States.
This was a—like a South American—you know, you read about South America. Every week, they have a coup, and they also do the attacks on political opponents, by the way. Your economy would take a $41 billion hit, this is Pennsylvania, gutting billions of dollars from your state and local budgets, slashing funding for your schools and police forces, and plunging Pennsylvania into severe economic depression.
Enjoy it. Look, if they get in, your state is screwed. Your state is—you guys are screwed. Good luck, everybody. Have a—have fun in Congress, Mike. But I will never let that happen. But you don't need to take my word for it alone. Kamala's anti-American energy crusade—let's just listen to her. Now, she's a totally—oh, no, I love fracking.
Let's just see what her video says. She had a tape just a little while ago. Let's go.
[start of pre-recorded video]
INTERVIEWER: Will you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking your first day in office, adding the United States to the list of countries who have banned this devastating practice?
KAMALA HARRIS: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. [booing]
[end of pre-recorded video]
TRUMP: OK? If I said that, nobody would believe it. So—and that's where she is. She's a radical left person who destroyed San Francisco, and she'll destroy the country just like she did California and San Francisco. She was the leader of that pack that destroyed San Francisco. It's not only Gavin New-scum.
Gavin New-scum, he's another beauty. Oh, we're doing great in the state. Everyone's leaving. ""We're doing great. The state's doing wonderfully."" They do have wonderful weather and it's a beautiful place, but it's overridden with crime. He is doing such a terrible job. He's a con man. You know, I watched him in the great Sean Hannity Show, and he was in, saying like ""No, the state has never done better. Never done —"" It's all fake. It's all lies. The state is a disaster. They're moving to Texas, Florida, Tennessee. They're moving to a lot of North Carolina, South Carolina.
When we win this November, we will end the Biden-Harris war on American energy and we will end their terrible war on fracking. Fracking is incredible, the money you make in Pennsylvania. You could quadruple your taxes if you—if you lost that industry, you could quadruple your taxes. The policy of the Trump administration will be to drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] Right? Right? I will also terminate the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one and save the US auto industry from destruction.
We are going to rebuild our auto industry. And the United Auto Workers are mostly going to vote for me, but, you know, they have a head of the United Auto Workers who's a fool. He's giving our auto industry to China by allowing this electric mandate to even be thought of. And again, I'm all for electric cars.
There's a certain little section that wants to have electric. I can understand that. But it's a small section. They want to have gasoline-powered cars, they want to have hybrids, and they're going to have that. They don't want to stop every 15 minutes. They refuse to stop. You know, I have a friend of mine, got an electric car, and he was used to driving from Kentucky, great state, to Washington.
And he drive, and, you know, he'd drive it. That would be it. Now, he's driving it. He had to stop six times. He said, ""What the hell is going on?"" He thought it was good for the environment. It's not good for—you know, he's an idealistic kind of guy. I think I'm going to do something good for the environment.
He got rid of that thing so fast; your head would spin. And it's great if you want to go to the candy store and back. Then you plug it in in your garage. It's no wonder the Democrat Party and their thugs are so desperate to stop us. They know that we are the only ones who can stop them, the only ones. You know, this is a movement—Make America Great Again.
This is a movement, the likes of which no country, but our country has never seen before. MAGA. MAGA. No country has ever seen anything like it. Remember when Biden would get up, ""We will stop MAGA."" He had no idea. I said, ""Joe, do you know what it means?"" ""No, not really."" No, it means Make America Great Again.
We don't want to stop it. All of their persecution is only happening because I am running for president and leading big in the polls. Oh, if I wasn't, I wouldn't have any of these lawsuits. Oh, they wouldn't be suing me because I'm breaking their ass, also. They wouldn't be suing me. They're doing this because I'm running and I'm leading, and I'm leading by a lot.
We're leading by a lot in this state, by the way, in this commonwealth. We're leading by a lot in our commonwealth. The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020, and we're not going to allow them to rig the presidential election of 2024. We're not going to allow it to happen. And every time the radical left Democrats, Marxists, communists, and fascists indict me, I consider it a great badge of honor.
Thank you very much. Because I'm being indicted for you. Did you like my mugshot? Did you like the mugshot? Lovely. My father's looking down—my mother and father, they're looking down because they're definitely in heaven. They made heaven. They're great. They're looking down, they said, ""I can't believe my son took a mugshot. This is unbelievable."" But it's the No. 1 selling mugshot in history. It beat Elvis and it beat Frank Sinatra. Did you know that? Frank Sinatra had a big one. Did you know he got arrested for something? And I think Elvis had a fight at a gas station or something. But Elvis was one. Frank Sinatra was two.
And I'm proud to admit and I'm proud to tell you that you have made mine bigger than both of them by a lot. It's the biggest-selling mug shot ever. And I still haven't figured out whether or not I'm happy about it. I'm not sure. In one way, I'm thrilled. In another way, I'm not sure I like it. Never forget, our enemies want to take away my freedom because I will never let them take away your freedom, which is true.
They want to silence me because I will never let them silence you. And in the end, they are not after me, they're after you. I just happened to be standing in their way, and I will continue to stand in their way. [cheers and applause] I will always be here. I'll be here. I don't know, I'm getting tired of protecting you, but I love it. [laughs] We're going to protect you.
We're going to go. And soon, you won't need protection because, soon, you're going to have a great country again. It's true. You won't need protection. The country will protect you. But think of it. I say this to—I got indicted more than Al Capone, the great Al Capone. Can you imagine? Al Capone, Scarface, the meanest man you've ever met, I have him beat.
But we're pleased to be joined today by some fantastic Pennsylvania patriots, friends of mine, incredible people, starting with the next US senator from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, David McCormick. He's incredible. He's a—come up. David, come up here. Come. He's a military hero. And honestly, you know, your senator, I don't think I ever met him in four years.
Nobody knows who he is. It's the weirdest thing. It's almost like how they keep getting elected. You got to elect this guy. He's a war hero. He's a national hero. He's a brilliant man. He went out, he made a fortune, and all that stuff. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. It means he's smart, right?
Do we agree? It means he's smart. You guys didn't make that much, but you're very smart anyway. But David has been a friend of mine. He's an incredible man and respected all over the place. And—and, you know, you have one chance to get a guy like this in. A lot of people, after watching my experience, they're not doing this anymore, are they?
So, I'd like to introduce Dave McCormick, a great guy. Hopefully, he's going to be your next senator. You're going to win, and you're going to win big, David.
DAVE MCCORMICK: Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. Thank you so much, all of you. And listen, in Pennsylvania, we know, Mr. President, this is the most important election of our lifetime. We know it. And we also know that this is ground zero, which is going to put you back in the White House and the majority in the Senate.
Right here, sir. Right here in Pennsylvania. And I want to welcome you back to Pennsylvania after Butler. We're so glad you're here, sir. Thank you. Thank you for being here. And I want to say what you all know, which is this is an incredibly important choice because we can continue to have the failed horrible policies of Biden, Harris, and Casey, and I say Casey because he votes 98 percent of the time, that destroys our economy: open borders, the fentanyl crisis, crime, the war on fossil fuels.
But it only gets worse. It only gets worse under Harris-Casey. It only gets worse, and that is why we need strong leadership, common sense leadership. And when I go on the campaign trail, Mr. President, the thing I hear that people want most is strength. And I tell them, listen, I'm a combat veteran, I'm an army wrestler.
And when I was standing there in Butler and saw those bullets flying, and I've seen people get shot at before, and you came up and put that fist in the air and said, ""Fight, fight, fight,"" I said to everybody, ""That strength, that's what we need for America. That's why we're going to win on November 5th."" God bless this commonwealth. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. Wow. Wow. That's great. You know, David, it is true. David was in Butler, and he was sitting exactly there. And, you know, Corey was sitting right behind him. Can you imagine? Corey was killed. He was sitting right behind David. And David didn't flinch. He didn't move. I mean, some people moved.
Actually, I think it was really known that when bullets are fired in a stadium, everyone really gets moving fast. They call it a stampede. Nobody moved. You looked at the people behind me, right? Everyone seen those people. Those people have become legendary. That was just a small group, the main tens of thousands of people around here, you couldn't even see the end, nobody ran, nobody moved.
They knew I was in trouble. They said, ""He's in trouble."" Every—if you went to a soccer stadium where you'll have a bullet go off, one bullet, the whole place runs for the exits. Nobody ran. And how about the man behind me with the black outfit and the green floppy hat? He's like this. David, did you see him? He's —
CROWD MEMBER: He's right there.
CROWD MEMBER: He's here.
TRUMP: He's staring. He's looking, right? Where? Get up here. Is that him? Yes. Wow. That's great, huh? Well, you're—you can be in a foxhole with me anytime, man. [steps away from podium] Wow. Thank you. That's great. That was a hell of a day, huh?
But there were a number of them back there. They were just brave. Everybody. There was nobody that fled. I think—I think nobody fled, right? They were brave people, and they were looking and they were pointing. They saw it. They were pointing. It was incredible. And one of these crowd control people that came in afterwards said they've never seen it where bullets are fired—and I'll tell you something, David was standing and sitting right—literally, the bullets were going over your head.
They were going over my head, too, the second group. But you weren't a flincher either, were you? You weren't. And Corey right alongside of you, right behind him. And you got to vote for this man. He's a hero and he's a great gentleman. He'll be a great senator. And it's time for a change. It's time for a change.
I mean that. A vote for Dave McCormick is a vote to seal our borders, stop migrant crime, defeat inflation, bring down prices, and defend Pennsylvania energy. You have to defend your energy. They will not allow fracking. As soon as—if they got in, her first move will be to end fracking all throughout the United States.
Dave is running against truly a not-a-good member. I don't like to be disrespectful. He's been there a long time. But Bob Casey is a stiff. He's a stiff. Nobody—nobody knows who the hell he is. I don't think I've ever gone to a meeting where he's been in the meeting, Mike. Mike has been in the meeting. Dan has been in the meeting. Scott is at too many meetings, right?
No, I don't think I've ever been—I don't think I've ever been to a meeting where Casey has even been there, and I've been to a lot of meetings with a lot of senators. But, you know, he just sort of goes along year after year. His father was there. He's there. We want to have a great warrior. Dave, good luck. Good luck. Thank you, David. Vote for him.
We're pleased to be joined today by some really fantastic people. Some, I would say, truly great warriors. And if you could, maybe Congress people, just stand up, right? Just stand up. Scott Perry, Mike Kelly, GT Thompson. GT, hi.
Dan Meuser, Lloyd Smucker. These are unbelievable warriors. These are great fighters. And if you can add David, it's going to be an unbeatable combination. Pennsylvania treasurer—thank you very much, fellas. You've done a great job. You've done a great job. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity, Lancaster County Commissioner Josh Parsons.
Great job, Josh. Jim Worthington, who's a fantastic man. Thank you. Thank you, Jim. Nice to see you. And two people that are amazing, very talented—very talented, very incredible people. One is a spokesman for the—lawyer, by the way, but a great spokesman, truly committed to make America great and me, but truly committed to make America great, which is more important than me, far more important.
I mean, it's just something special. She has been an incredible person going around and—and letting people know how important our country is, how we love our country. Alina Habba. Alina. Stand up, Alina. I didn't know she was going to be here today. [cheers and applause] And another person, one of the most talented writers, a person who truly has the pulse of this area, Pennsylvania, and the Rust Belt, in general—the Rust Belt is her territory.
Nobody covers it better. Salena Zito. Salena. Where are you, Salena? Where are you? Thank you. She's a great—she's a great writer. We're also joined by Tiffany Hall, a single mother of four from Columbia, Pennsylvania who wants to tell us firsthand what the Biden-Harris inflation nightmare has done to her family. It's destroyed her family. Tiffany, please come up. Please. Thank you. Thank you, Tiffany. This is happening all over America because of inflation, by the way. Thanks, Tiffany. Thank you, darling. Go have fun.
[Off-mic] That's OK. Go. Here you go.
TIFFANY HALL: Thank you very much. So, gas prices are just astronomical. Being able to afford anything for my children anymore like sports is just kind of out of the question now. When President Trump was in, I could do these things with them. Since then, I have not been able to. I can't put them into sports. I can't go on extravagant vacations anymore. We can go to free parks around here. I—I miss it. I miss when we didn't have to pull out of our pockets for things. I'm hoping we can get back to a point where I'm financially stable —
TRUMP: You will.
HALL: And others. I know I can't be the only one. We're all going to the gas pump and being like, man, here goes the last of what I have. I don't know. [applause] Thank you.
I would like to be able to go into a grocery store again and not have to put something back or say, ""Nope, we can't do a nice cake from the bakery. We have to try and do one from home."" So, I really hope and pray that we can make America great again and get you back in office. [steps away from podium] Thank you. Thank you.
TRUMP: Wow. Thank you, Tiffany. So, cute. You know, she said, ""Oh, I can't believe it. I left my notes down —"" on her seat. I said just go and wing it, and she did better. You did better than if you had your notes, Tiffany. I have to be honest. That's great. You did better. Thank you. Appreciate it. Things like that happen. I said, ""Well, give it a shot."" She did better.
Starting on day one of the Trump administration, we will end inflation and we will make America great again. We will deliver regulation cuts, energy price cuts, interest rate cuts, and we will drive prices down, and we'll drive them down very fast. We will pass massive tax cuts for workers, and that includes no tax on tips. [cheers and applause]
To protect Pennsylvania jobs, I will revoke China's most favored nation trade status. I will pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay a 100 percent or 200 percent tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of 100 percent or 200 percent right back. You hurt us and we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye.
Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we win the presidency, and it's we win the presidency, I mean that, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. [cheers and applause] And I am the only one that can say that. I know all the players, and they respect us, they respect me. And they used to respect our country but no longer.
I will prevent World War III. That's where we're heading. We're heading to World War III, and you see it. I will restore peace through strength. Over and over again, our enemies have watched Biden and Harris signal a lack of will, total weakness to do what's necessary to protect American people and stand up for our allies.
A week ago, the prime minister of our closest Middle Eastern ally, Israel, came to address Congress. You saw that. Instead of sending a clear signal that the United States will never abandon an ally, a very important one, Kamala chose to politicize the moment, to grandstand, making a show of refusing to attend.
You know where she was? She went to a sorority party. Can you believe it? Even though it was her duty as president of the Senate to be there. It was her duty to be there. Her Democrat allies fell in line. Chuck Schumer refused to shake the Israeli prime minister's hand. Chuck Schumer has become a Palestinian.
Yes, he has. Can you believe it? He's become a proud member of Hamas. Nancy Pelosi likewise denounced the speech in shameful terms. You know, 15 years ago, Israel had the strongest, most powerful lobby in this country. Now, it's almost the opposite, with AOC plus three and all the people, the enemies of our country in a true sense.
But they are. And the enemies, when they saw all these people abandoned Israel, they took note. And I don't think it's accidental that just four days after Harris and Biden repudiated our Israeli allies, Iran's top terrorist group, Hezbollah, fired an Iranian missile to kill 12 innocent children at a soccer field in northern Israel.
It happened right after he left. With great embarrassment, he left. The terrorists did it because they assumed they could get away with it because the United States is weak and ineffective and no longer respected. We are no longer respected. We are a failing nation. I mean, it's horrible. You don't want to say it. I wish I didn't have to say it. I wish I could say they're doing a phenomenal job.
I wouldn't run. I wouldn't run. I wouldn't have to run. I would be very happy to have somebody do a phenomenal job. I wouldn't have to run, and I'd be very happy with that. I'd be proud of our country. But right now, our country is a joke. It's being laughed at all over the world. The truth is Harris' and Biden's weakness is inviting every rogue enemy worldwide to absolutely get away with murder.
In my next term, we will build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our country, a dome like has never been seen before, and it will be entirely made in the USA and right here in Pennsylvania, big sections of it. And I will cut—remember this, I will cut all of the bad talk about Social Security.
They're going to destroy your Social Security, but I will not cut one cent from Social Security or Medicare. And I kept my promise for four years, and I will keep it again. And seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security, and they won't—they won't. There are the people, it's up to you. No tax on Social Security.
By contrast, Kamala cast a tie-breaking vote to cut Medicare, you saw this, by $237 billion in a heartless betrayal of American seniors. We're going to rebuild our cities into beacons of hope, safety, and beauty, better than they have ever been before. We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, DC, clean it up, renovate it, fix it, rebuild it. We will again have the most beautiful capital anywhere in the world.
And there will be no crime, no crime allowed, very strong. Right now, you go there, you get mugged, you get shot. On day one, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the lives of our children. [cheers and applause]
And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate. [cheers and applause] And I will keep men out of women's sports. How simple is that? [cheers and applause] I will fully uphold our Second Amendment, as I did for four years. We just got the backing of the NRA, complete and total endorsement from the NRA. We will protect innocent life, and we will restore free speech to our country again.
And very importantly, I will secure our elections. Our goal will be one-day voting with paper ballots, proof of citizenship, voter ID. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause] A lot of other countries are doing it. The mail-in voting isn't working. It's corrupt. But until then, Republicans must win. We want to have a landslide because the best way to protect against the rigging, and these people know it, is too big to rig.
There's a level at which they can't cheat. So, if you want to save America, get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and vote, vote early, vote absentee, vote on Election Day. I don't care when you vote, but whatever you do, you have to vote and make sure your ballot counts because these people cheat.
They cheat like dogs. And if you want to help us ensure election integrity, sign up at protectthevote.com, protectthevote.com. And in conclusion, from Easton to Hershey, from Jamestown to Allentown, and from Pittsburgh to right here in beautiful Harrisburg—we love Harrisburg. We got a lot of votes in Harrisburg.
We stand on the shoulders of American legends who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears for our rights and for our freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of that. Think of the history that this great, great place—it's beautiful. Pennsylvania, think of the history that you have.
It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge where General George Washington—we're never taking his name off any buildings. They'd like to. When they want to take Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson off, it ain't gonna happen. But it will happen under her. George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware and where the union was saved by the immortal heroes at Gettysburg.
Gettysburg. Wow. [cheers and applause] Gettysburg. And this is the state where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania miners and steelworkers forged the greatest nation in the history of the world. But now, we are a nation in serious decline. We are a failing nation. We are a nation that has lost its confidence, lost its willpower, and lost its strength.
We are a nation that has lost quite simply its way. But we are not going to allow this horror to continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation. And we will soon be a great nation again. [cheers and applause] Soon be. With our leadership, every disaster Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have created can be fixed and be quick—very quickly.
We're going to do it so quickly. Remember, I used to tell the story, we're going to win, win, win, right? We're going to win so much; you're going to get tired of winning. We're going to win. We're going to start winning. ""Please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. We can't take it anymore."" We're going to win, win, win.
Every problem can be solved and every wrong can be rectified. By this time next year, America's borders will be strong, sealed, and secure. Inflation will be a full thing of the past. It will be in full retreat. Our economy will be roaring back. Optimism will be surging. The American dream will be thriving again for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
Law and justice will reign all throughout our land. Freedom will be restored. The flame of liberty will be burning bright. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the worst administration in the history of our country, will be a fading memory of the past. And our great silent majority, including the once-forgotten men and women of our country, will be the ones shaping America's magnificent future when I am the 47th president of the United States because we are all Americans; and together, we will show November 5th to be the most important day in the history of our country.
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America strong again, make America proud again, make America safe again, make America free again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania.
God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

    [music: Village People, YMCA.]
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
[music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. I love Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. I really give a very big hello to Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
It's great to be back in this beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots, which is what you are. Think of this. Who would believe this? 80 days from now, we are going to defeat a communist known as Kamala Harris, the most radical left person ever to run for office. This is not what this country needs. We've had enough of them. We're going to win back the White House and we're going to take back our country. [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris is a super-left liberal who ruined San Francisco, ruined California [booing] and delivered a badly broken economy, a badly broken border, which gave us a dangerous world of chaos, death, and destruction. Just take a look at what's happening today. We were a respected country. Now the whole world laughs at us. We're a bunch of foolish people to have allowed this to happen, but we're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back very fast.
We'll close up the borders. We'll drill, baby drill. [cheers and applause]
We're going to do things that are going to be very good, very good, very fast. It'll happen very quickly, but she breaks everything that she touches. But soon we're going to fix every single problem Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe have—what happened to Biden? I was running against Biden. All of a sudden I'm running against somebody else. It's true. You know, it's interesting.
I said, ""Who am I running against?""
""Harris.""
I said, ""Who the hell is Harris?""
""You don't know. Who the hell is Harris?"" [laughter]
She was the first one out last time. She was the first one to lose, and now all of a sudden she's running. She never got a vote. They are a threat to democracy, remember that.
Starting the day I take the Oath of Office, I will rapidly drive prices down and we will make America affordable again. [cheers and applause] We're going to make it affordable again. Under Kamala Harris and crooked Joe Biden, the American dream was dead and it is dead. It's dead as a doornail. They'll never bring it back unless we win. If we win, we're going to have the American dream alive. [cheers and applause]
All for your beautiful children, your grandchildren, we'll have the American dream, will be back with us. [cheers and applause] Her radical liberal policies, of course, horrific inflation decimated the middle class and gutted the finances of millions of American families. And you know what I'm talking about because everybody in this room has been devastated by what they've done. They have no idea. They're grossly incompetent people.
Real incomes are down by over $2,000 a year. Think of that. Minimum. And ours, up five times that amount, more than five times that amount. Her price hikes have cost a typical household a total of $28,000, and that's called the Kamala Harris Inflation Tax.
She was there for everything. You know when she sits and complains,—hey, look, look,—Joe Biden hates her, okay, hates her. You don't mind if I go off teleprompter for a second, do you? [cheers and applause] Joe Biden hates her.
This was an overthrow of a president. This was an overthrow. They went out and I spent a hundred million dollars fighting Joe Biden. They told him he couldn't win. His debate performance wasn't the best ever, [laughter] but they said mine was the best ever. But they said his debate performance wasn't. I look forward to debating her, by the way. She'll be easier, she'll be easier than him. [cheers] Her policies are so bad. Her policy, remember her father was a Marxist economic professor. He was a Marxist, an avowed Marxist. This is not what we want in this country. And think of it. Does anyone here feel richer under Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: Is anything less expensive under Kamala Harris or Crooked Joe?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: No, no. It's been devastating. Inflation. Inflation has been devastating under this group of people that have no idea what the hell they're doing.
Are you better off with Kamala and Biden than you were under President Donald J. Trump? I don't think so. They do polls and this stuff and I'm at like 93%. I said, ""Why are we having an election? They didn't have an election. Why are we having an election?""
How would you like to be Biden? He's working. He's spending money. He's trying. They wanted to have a debate. That's the thing that started it all. If I didn't debate him, he'd still be running right now. But I believe she will be easier to beat than him—[cheers and applause] because she's a truly radical left lunatic.
And with him, he never really believed it. Of course, I don't know if he knew anything. I am not sure. But he didn't really believe it. She totally believes it. She wants to destroy our country.
With four more years of Kamala, your finances will never recover. They will only get worse. They're only going to get worse. The stock market, and we have some of the most brilliant people on Wall Street saying the stock market is only up because they think I'm going to win and if we don't win, according to many people, including one of the greatest Wall Street prognosticators, Scott Bessent—has anyone heard of him? One of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, if I don't win, you will have a 1929 style depression. Enjoy it. I believe that. I believe that. I believe it. A lot of people believe it, so we're not going to give them the chance, okay? We're not going to give them.
And your state's going to be ruined anyway, she's totally anti-fracking. She's been anti- fracking and anti-drilling, anti-oil and gas from practically the day she was born. All of a sudden a couple of months ago, she said, ""Oh, I'd love to have fracking."" No, she won't have fracking.
Vote Trump and your incomes will soar. Your savings will grow. Young people will be able to afford a home,—[cheers] and we will bring back the American dream bigger. [cheers and applause] We are going to bring it back. Bigger, better front-row Joe. Bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We're going to bring it back. Look at all these front-row Joes over here. They've only been, we have a couple of groups here. They're at about 222 events. Front-Row Joes, stand up, wave your hands, there, you guys are great. Patriots. [cheers and applause]
But I have another group from a place called North Carolina. Has anybody ever heard of North? We love North Carolina. The beautiful ladies over there. This is number, what? 217, so this is number 217, and supposedly they're happily married. How the hell does that work? Look at them. [gestures towards crowd member] They're beautiful and they, oh, there's a husband. Are you a husband? Who are you married to husband? Oh, that was a wise choice. Beautiful. Very nice.
How do you handle it, right? How do you handle? But they're great women and they've been with us from the very beginning. [cheers and applause] They were with us from the beginning in 2016 when we had the four greatest years this country has ever had. They were with us then. Thank you very much.
North Carolina. We're doing well in North Carolina. Thank you, darling. It's nice to not have to travel to California and other places, right?
Yesterday, Kamala laid out her so-called economic plan. She says she's going to lower the cost of food and housing starting on day one, but day one for Kamala was three and a half years ago so why didn't she do it then? [cheers]
This is day 1,305. We're at 1,305. So why isn't she doing it now? Why doesn't she get away from her nice little place with her wonderful husband, go to Washington and do it now? You could do it right now.
Why does she go to the convention? Because it's a rigged convention, obviously. She got no votes. He had 14,—you know—sleepy Joe had 14 million votes. She got no votes. She failed. She was the first one out. She failed. She never got to Iowa. Great state, Iowa. We're going to win it big. The farmers love Trump and I love the farmers, but she never got to Iowa. She was the first one to quit and now she's running for president. —I don't know—.
Somebody's going to have to explain our system to our many enemies all around the world. They're watching, they're saying, ""This place doesn't make a lot of sense anymore.""
Everything Kamala Harris says in her speeches is a lie. She gets up and just lies. I was watching her yesterday. She talked about all the taxes I was going to raise. I never said that. I'm lowering taxes.
Yesterday she got up. She started ranting and raving that Donald Trump wants to put a tax on gasoline, a tax on food, a tax on medication, a tax on clothing, a tax on every single thing that was ever invented. Your hat, he's going to tax. Your shirt, he is going to tax. He's going to tax your wife; he's going to tax your husband. And I'm saying, I never said any of that. They make it up.
Here's the truth. Kamala wants to put massive taxes on American jobs and American industries. I want to cut taxes on Americans while putting tariffs on China and foreign countries to bring our jobs back home to Pennsylvania and to take in billions and billions of dollars. [cheers and applause]
I'm the only one that ever took in any money from China. China was really hitting us hard, ripping us apart, that means many, many presidents. And what happened is I put a tariff on then I raised the tariff. We took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China and—Biden gets so much money; he's trying to rescind it for a couple of reasons.
Number one, he got a lot of money from China. Didn't he get three and a half million, 4 million that they know of? But he got a lot more than that. His family made a lot of money with China. He wants to get rid of the tariff, but he can't because there's so much money they can't do anything with the budget. A tariff is a tax on a foreign country. That's the way it is, whether you like it or not. A lot of people like to say it's a tax on us. No, no, no. It's a tax on a foreign country.
It's a tax on a country that's ripping us off and stealing our jobs and it's a tax that doesn't affect our country. [cheers] And you could see hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs on other countries also. I took in hundreds of billions and nothing happened to us.
They make less money. And you know what? Our jobs come back because there's no tax if they build their factory in Pennsylvania, there's no tax if they build their factory in the United States. So what do they do in order to avoid paying the tax? They say, ""Let's build a place over here. No tax."" Come on over. We love it. Just hire our people. That's all you have to do. It's very simple.
As we speak, and this really goes to Michigan more than you, but I look at Michigan and South Carolina, a lot of other places that do the auto stuff, and they are building some of the biggest auto factories in the world right now in Mexico, right off our border. They think they're going to make cars, not pay any tax and sell those cars into the United States. Not going to happen. Not with me.
They're building some of the biggest auto plants in the world. And you know who owns those auto plants? They're built. They're made and being built in Mexico. You know who owns them? China owns them.
China's very smart. I had a good relationship with President Xi. When Covid came, that was the end of that relationship. But I had a very good relationship. But we took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Think of it, Bush, Barack Hussein—did you ever hear of Barack Hussein Obama? [booing] Have you heard of her? [booing]
There are those that think he is currently running the country. Does anybody think? [booing] I don't know. I don't know that that's true. We know it's not Biden.
Every attack Kamala makes on us is a fabricated, it's a lie. She's a bad storyteller. She doesn't know how to tell a story very well, but she gets caught, she got caught up in her own words. She's not a very good wordsmith they say. I don't know. We're going to find out.
We're going to have a debate at some point. They gave me—the worst network to me is ABC, worse than NBC, worse than CBS, worse than CNN. The home of George Stephanopoulos, —a nasty guy. I said, ""George, I've had you up to here."" It's true. He's a nasty guy. The hatred. And yet when he interviews Biden, two weeks ago, he interviewed Biden, it was like the nicest interview. ""What flavor ice cream do you like?"" ""George, I tend to vanilla very much."" [laughter]
With me they get into a lot of subjects that a lot of people don't like talking about. But ABC is the worst. And that seems because they won't do it on Fox. They've turned down the Fox. I've approved three debates. They've approved one. The only one they've approved was their network.
And now it came out in the New York Times of all places that the head of the news and the head of the whole thing practically is Kamala and her husband, lovely husband, best friend, her and her husband are best friends with Kamala and her husband. And I'm supposed to do the debate.
But with Biden, they thought I wouldn't do it so they offered me something that I couldn't accept. They said, ""The debate is at CNN in front of no audience."" So far, I'm oh for two. And see, they didn't want to do the debate. That would've been a good idea if they didn't do it, but I was going to accept anything. Then I guess we'll do it here too, right? We'll accept anything because otherwise she's not going to debate.
She doesn't want to debate, but they said, ""CNN and no audience, and we want to have you sit down."" I objected to that. They wanted us sitting behind the desk. I said, ""Give me a break. We have to at least stand for the American public."" Wouldn't that be nice? [cheers and applause]
That was the only thing, and I would've done it if they insisted. No, I would've sat down if they insisted. But I thought it was sort of a little strange. But I had Dana Bash and I had Jake Tapper. But I have to tell you, they were very fair. I really thought they were very fair.
Jake and Dana, nobody knows how to say her first name. Is it Dana or Dana? Nobody knows. It's been going on for 20 years. She's been around a long time. Is it Dana or Dana? And now the fake news will say, ""Trump didn't know how to pronounce her first name."" She doesn't know how to pronounce, but look, but Dana and Jake, I used to call him Fake Tapper. Now I call him Jake Tapper because he treated us very fairly and so did Dana treat me very fairly.
I think it was just about neutral. But he kept saying—he gave very short answers because he wasn't really doing too well. And I kept saying, ""I'll take it."" But what happened? ""Sir, you have 92 seconds left."" This is not what he wanted to hear. [gestures to David McCormick] Right, David?
They said, ""You have 92 seconds left,"" going to be your next senator I'll tell you, David McCormick. [cheers and applause] I hope you can vote for him. I hope you vote for him.
I hope you vote for him. He is a great gentleman, great hero actually in many ways. He's a great guy.
But so they gave me this thing and they assumed I was going to turn it down so I have the wrong network. I have the wrong anchors. I have no audience. I like an audience. I love people. [cheers and applause]
It's oftentimes a mistake.
Everything was wrong. So what we'll do is we'll offer him this thing that he can't accept. He won't accept it. And then we'll say, ""Trump didn't accept the debate. He's afraid to negotiate against Biden because Biden is so sharp. He's so sharp. He's sharp like a razor.""
But I surprised them. I said, ""I'll take it. I'll take it."" And people said, ""Are you crazy?"" I said, ""Look, it's the only way you're going to debate. If we do anything else, they're not going to accept it."" And these people are the same way. They offered me – we, we were supposed to have Fox on September 4th. And they said, ""No."" I accepted it. I don't even know what's going to happen because I've accepted it. They haven't. So maybe they show up, maybe they don't. But I think it's sort of on for September 4th, but I don't think they're going to come. And then we go and we do the debate with ABC.
ABC, again, I call it ABC Fake News, so bad. They're so bad. They're so dishonest, in my opinion. Very dishonest people. But I find them to be the worst. And I really am a professional at this because I watch the—who treats me the worst?
Now, NBC is horrible. CBS is horrible. They're all horrible. These are horrible human beings. But who treats me the worst? ABC Fake News treats me the worst. And that's where they want it.
Where her best friend—it just came out the other day. Nobody told anybody about this, is the head of the whole deal, right? But I'll probably say, ""I'll take it"" because you know what they're not going to do a debate? But just remember, these are phony, fake, disgusting people that hate our country. [cheers]
Remember that. And also remember that every attack that we make on Kamala is something that she said on tape or something that she's actually done. All of these attacks are things because she said all of it. She said, ""I don't want fracking in Pennsylvania."" She said it hundreds of times. ""I don't want it anywhere,"" then a couple of months ago, when the polls are showing that she's getting clobbered, well actually, nobody actually thought they were politically correct. They wanted to be politically correct because they wanted, they had 11 different people and they put her name in to be number 12, and they had a vote. She came in last.
So she picked somebody, think of it, how about the guy she picked, how bad is he, right? How bad is that guy? David, where do these people come from? [cheers and applause]
He recently signed a bill in a state that I love, but a state that hasn't been won by a Republican because it's a corrupt state, but the people are not corrupt. The people are great. Since 1972 hasn't been won. And I thought we won it twice, I said, ""There's no way we lose Minnesota."" But he signed a bill for all young men's bathrooms and men's bathrooms, have to be equipped with a tampon-selling machine. [booing] And she turned down, your governor, by the way, just so you understand, I know some of you probably like him. [booing] I don't think he's a good person. I don't think he's good. I don't think he's good. But they turned him down because he's Jewish. Okay. That's why they turned him down.
Now we can be politically correct and not say that. I could say, ""Well, they turned him down for various reasons."" No, no. They turned him down because he's Jewish, that's why they turned him down. And I'll tell you this, any Jewish person that votes for her or a Democrat has to go out and have their head examined because if you see what's happening with Israel and Jewish people right now, there has never been a more dangerous time since the Holocaust. If you happen to be Jewish in America, there's never been anything like it.
I'm seeing things, I can't even believe it, and we want to bring about unity and peace and everything else. It looks like they're going to have nothing but riots out there in Chicago. It's really a sad thing. But they turned him down for that reason and they turned him down for a couple of other reasons too. But the primary reason was that he's Jewish.
And you don't think I know what goes on in their campaign. I know it well. I know it very well. She's a nation-wrecker who is more liberal than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know Crazy Bernie. He's pretty bad, right? She is substantially more radicalized than Crazy Bernie.
You cannot have her as your president. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined the state of California. No, she was a district attorney, and she was the attorney general of the state.
I heard the other day, and this isn't anything, I'm just saying—they'll say, ""He was rambling."" I don't ramble. I'm really smart guy, really smart. I don't ramble. But the other day, anytime I hit too hard, they say he was rambling. Rambling? I get up and I make a speech. I go for sometimes two hours, two and a half hours, because people are waiting outside for three days, four days. You guys were waiting out there for a long time. Front row Joes are waiting out—I don't know how you guys do it. And I feel I have an obligation to speak, and speak in a certain way, and speak a little bit longer.
You know? How would you like it? A guy's waiting with his family for three and a half, four days. They have a tent, and the tent is set up. They have hundreds of them, and they wait. And then I walk in, speak for 15 minutes, and leave. I don't know, somehow, would that be okay, North Carolina? I don't think so, right?
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: They want me to speak all day. When I leave, I did one, two hours and 15 minutes, and I'm leaving, and they're screaming, ""No, sir, more! We want to hear more!"" I said, ""I can't!"" I said, ""I can't speak more! What the hell else am I going to say? Our country's going to hell. That's all I can say. We're a nation in decline.""
You know we were talking about that before. My phrases are copied so much, right? I use the term, oftentimes in closing, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failed nation."" And I think it's a beautiful phrase, although I don't like the topic very much, I don't like what it represents, but there's a certain beauty.
All of a sudden, all of these candidates, including Republicans, are saying, ""We are a nation in decline. We are a failing nation."" And I say, You know, what the hell do they have to copy me for? Right?
But they have a lot of words that they copy, many of our words.
We were in the plane before coming in, and our people said—we went through a list. I think we're going to release a list. Let's release it. But so many of our phrases, they copy. Really, that should be a nice thing. Not an insult.
But crazy Bernie Sanders has said a lot of things, and one of the things he's arguing about is who's more liberal. And after about two minutes, he gave up. He said, ""This woman is nuts.""
Look, people say be nice. Have you heard her laugh? That is the laugh of a crazy person. That is the laugh of a crazy. It's the laugh of a lunatic. [cheers and applause] Have you heard it? You know, they prohibited her. They prohibited her for laughing. I've been waiting for her to laugh, because as soon as she laughs, the election's over. But we're winning by a lot in Pennsylvania. I think the fracking got her. [cheers and applause] The fracking got her.
But she has been prohibited from laughing. She used to do an interview, she'd go ha-ha-ha. Who the hell laughs at an interview like that? I'm interviewed all the time, I may smile. They're asking you questions about things that—It's not like a comedy club. And she'd break out. That's one of the reasons she refuses to do interviews, I think, because she laughs, it's so horrible. No, it's so horrible.
But you know she hasn't done an interview in 30 days or something like that? And I do one every day. If I pass—I just did one backstage. [cheers and applause] I just did one backstage with a very good reporter. But you're supposed to. Don't you sort of have an obligation? You know you're running. They're going to try. This is her form of the basement.
Now, the basement for him was good because they had COVID, they didn't want him to catch COVID, he ended up catching it anyway. But uh the whole system is very dishonest, but she should be at least talking to the press. She hasn't done anything.
But she's prohibited from laughing. They said, ""Your laugh is horrible. Never laugh, ever."" So, she's walking around with her mouth almost sealed shut. She won't laugh. I want her to laugh! And then we'll just claim victory. Ladies and gentlemen, like to thank you very much. But we have a little video that we just put up. Would you like to see it?
CROWD: YES
TRUMP: Go ahead. Just one.
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris's statements]: Yeah, I am a radical. You need to get radical about what we're doing, and take it seriously. As president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. We have to have a buyback program, and I support a mandatory buyback program.
JAKE TAPPER: I believe it will totally eliminate private insurance.
HARRIS: Let's eliminate all of that.
ERIN BURNETT: But would you support changing the dietary guidelines?
HARRIS: Yes.
BURNETT: You know, the food pyramid?
HARRIS: Yes.
BURNETT: To reduce red meat specifically?
HARRIS: Yes, I would.
INTERVIEWER 1: Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
EBRO DARDEN: Where do you stand on defund the police?
HARRIS: This whole movement is about rightly saying we need to take a look at these budgets.
UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1: Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern day Ku Klux Klan.
HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception-
UNNAMED SPEAKER 1: I see no-
HARRIS: Are you aware that there's a perception—
SPEAKER 1: —perception that puts ICE in the same category as the KKK. Is that where you're asking me? I see no parallel.
HARRIS: I'm not finished.
SPEAKER 1: I see none.
HARRIS: Maybe I am a radical. We need to get radical about what we are doing.
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: Now, over the years, and right up until the present, she wanted to openly defund the police. How do you like that?
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: In Minnesota, when they were burning down the state, and in particular Minneapolis, they were burning it down. Remember the CNN fake reporter? He got up—the one with the nice, shaved head, he got up. ""This is a peaceful rally. This is a rally of love."" Behind him, the entire city was burning. It looked like World War II, right?
And by the way, speaking of World War II, she will bring us into World War III, and it will be—that'll be a war like never before, because of the weaponry. No more army tanks going back and forth shooting.
We've left a lot of our – you know, I rebuilt the entire military, and we left a lot of that in a place called Afghanistan. You know that? Billions and billions of dollars, we left it. In the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, we left billions of dollars. 13 great soldiers killed. Think of it. Left many hostages. Many people have been left behind. But think of what happened there. We got out in disgrace. We should have gotten out with strength. I was getting out. We would've been out even sooner, but strength, dignity, we would've kept Bagram.
The big air base. You know who occupies Bagram right now? China. Because it was one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Not because of Afghanistan, but because of China. But China occupies it right now. Thank you very much, President Xi, enjoy our billions of dollars of construction that took place years ago. They spent billions of dollars many years ago. One hour away, think of that, where they make their nuclear weapons. It's so embarrassing, the stupidity of the people that have run our country. But we did things the opposite way. We were very smart, we were very respected, we were a respected country. They respected your leader, elected leader.
But remember this. Viktor Orban of Hungary, prime minister of Hungary, they asked him pretty recently, they said, ""What's going on? The world is coming to an end."" He said, ""If you want to stop it, reelect—the United States, reelect Donald Trump. [cheers and applause] Because when he was there, he didn't have any problems. We didn't have problems."" Russia wouldn't have happened with Ukraine. Israel would've never been attacked on October 7th, never.
You know Iran was broke? Iran was broke. They had no money. I told China, ""You buy oil from them, you can't deal with us."" I told that to many countries, anybody that dealt there, so they didn't buy oil. Oil's the whole thing, the big deal. And they were broke. Now they have $3 billion, think of it. They have $300 billion now, they have plenty of money.
We're run by stupid people, and we have to change it, or we're not going to have a country left. We didn't let countries take advantage of us. France was going to charge our corporations tremendous amounts of money for doing business in France. You know this, David. David is very familiar with what happened. And I went to my people. I said, ""Tell them we're not going to put up with it. They're not going to charge our companies, because we want our companies to do well so they can employ people."" It's sort of simple.
I didn't even like a lot of the companies that they were dealing with. I should have said, ""Oh, great, let them charge. What the hell do I care?"" But they're American companies. And I said to Macron, I said, ""Call him, because my people failed to make a deal."" I said, ""You make a deal, you have one week. Come see me.""
At the end of a week, they came to see me. Good people, smart people, very smart people. Secretary of Treasury, smart guy, Mnuchin, others. They came back to see me.
""Sir, we're not able to make a deal. They're going to charge our companies a tax.""
I said, ""No, no, they're not going to do it. You don't understand. They're not going to do it. Come back and see me. You have one more day.""
They came back, ""Sir, they won't do it. They've already passed it in their so-called legislature. We're not going to do it. They're not going to be able to stop it, sir.""
I said, ""We'll stop it. Get Emmanuel Macron on the phone.""
I got him on the phone. ""Emmanuel, how are you? So nice to talk.""
""Oh, Donald, Donald, it is so nice to speak to you."" It's beautiful. I wish I had his accent; I would've been president 20 years ago.
But I said, ""Emmanuel, I understand you're charging our companies a lot of money?"" ""Oh, well, this has been in the works for many years, you know Donald. Yes, it is done, it is really done. There's nothing we can do about it.""
I said, ""Okay, good. Emmanuel, here's the story. If you don't get rid of that tax within 24 hours, starting on Monday morning,"" it was a Friday, ""I'm going to charge every bottle of wine and champagne that you send into our country. I'm going to charge you a tariff of 100% on every bottle, and you will not be sending too many bottles of champagne."" [cheers and applause]
And he said, ""Donald, Donald, that is not fair. That is not fair.""
I said, ""No, no. It's not fair for you to be charging American companies to do business in your country. No, it's not fair, Emmanuel. Emmanuel, get back to me in five minutes and let me know.""
He called me back in two minutes.
He said, ""Donald, we have decided that we will not be charging you any taxes for the American companies."" [cheers and applause]
I did so many of them. I did so many. I could stand up here all day and tell you different stories. I just used the telephone. I could stop the war with a telephone. I could stop what's happening in the Middle East with a couple of telephone calls, properly placed. [cheers and applause] Horrible. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We have people that are babies. In many ways, I guess they're stupid. People say, ""Please don't use bad language! Please don't call people stupid!"" They're stupid people. How else do you describe it? I want to use a different word, highly—a more sophisticated word than stupid, but there's no word. It's a perfect word. They're stupid people. I think they're also, by the way, if I might, they're also corrupt. They really are, they're corrupt. They get a lot of money from a lot of people.
We're not going to let this socialist lunatic—and she's a socialist lunatic. That's the other thing. ""Please, sir. Please don't call her a lunatic."" I said, ""But that's what she is."" She's a lunatic. [cheers and applause] She's a lunatic. She's going to destroy our country.
And she's going to break our economy even more than it's broken. We have a broken economy. Our supply chain is gone.
You order something now, I don't know how many of you are in business, or even if you're ordering as a personal order, the order doesn't come. The supply chain is broken. Whoever thought of it, we never even talked about supply chain. Supply chain just worked. And because of what they've done, they've broken our supply chain.
On election day, we're going to tell her that we've had enough. We said, ""Kamala, you're a horrible vice president, you're going to be a horrible president. We're not going to take it anymore. KAMALA, you're fired! Get out of there! You're fired!"" [cheers and applause]
Not going to take it anymore, Kamala. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: We're not going to take it anymore. We have a country to save. And how about the fake news? [gestures towards media] Oh, look at them all back here, look at all those cameras. [booing]
TRUMP: Look at all those cameras. Wow. Look at all those cameras, all those fake writers. Look at them. [booing]
Time Magazine, think of this. Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her. They have this unbelievable artist drawing her. And I said, ""Is that Sophia Loren?"" I couldn't—who might that be? Is that Elizabeth Taylor? They say she was a beautiful woman. Who is it? It's so beautiful. Drawing. It's a drawing. They took a lot of pictures, it didn't work out, so they hired a sketch artist.
I said, ""I'm sure, oh, they must be celebrating the great life and times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Loren."" And you're not allowed to say this anymore. You know, David, don't ever get caught in this trap, David, please. Don't ever call a woman beautiful, because that'll be the end of your political career. Please. I want to make your life much easier, David. By the way, he's also got a great wife, I have to say, he's got a great wife. [applause]
But you know, I read a so-called Republican, who Ronald Reagan didn't like, by the way, and she didn't like him, but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer. Highly overrated. I don't know anything about her, I don't know her. Treats me badly, but that's okay. She called it wrong. She's called it wrong now for about eight years. But she said one thing that got me. She said Kamala has one big advantage. She's a very beautiful woman. [laughter]
CROWD: BOO
TRUMP: She's a beautiful woman. So, I decided to go back and reread the clause. ""I'm not saying he's —"" but I say that I am much better looking than her. [cheers and applause] I think I'm much better, much better. I'm a better looking person than Kamala! No, I couldn't believe it. I had never heard that one. They said, ""No, her biggest advantage is that she's a beautiful woman."" I'm going, ""Huh."" I never thought of that. I'm better looking than she is. [cheers]
In her speech yesterday, Kamala went full communist. You heard that? She went full communist. She wants to destroy our country. After causing catastrophic inflation, Comrade Kamala announced that she wants to institute socialist price controls. You saw that? Never worked before. Never ever worked.
This is the Maduro plan. Venezuela Maduro plan of the old Soviet Union. They tried it. How did the Soviet Union work out? It became Russia, smaller version. It was a smaller version. It will cause rationing, hunger, and skyrocketing prices, just like their Inflation Reduction Act caused. One of the great scams of all time.
They got it approved with a beautiful name: Inflation Reduction. Because inflation, under their system, has been so bad. It's gone up much more than 50%. They say, ""30, 40, 50."" Much more. People are being devastated. They're being devastated. But it's gone way up, way up. And they made a big mistake yesterday in her speech. I think she said, I had to play it back. I love the playback controls you have nowadays. They used to call it TiVo, now they have TiVo, all the—I think it's the single greatest invention. It's better than television, because television would drive you crazy if you couldn't do a playback, right? Now I can playback. I heard the statement, and I heard that statement that she made, and she made a statement yesterday that, from her time in office, essentially, prices have gone up by 50%, something like—I said, ""Did she just say that?"" I said, ""That speech writer is going to be fired."" In fact, we took that section and we actually made a commercial on it, and we got the best commercial of the week, and we didn't do anything. We just played her back.
But here's the problem. The things that she said yesterday don't work. They have never worked. They've never been used. Many times before, in many other countries, they've never worked. They've just never worked. They've been used oftentimes, many countries, and in every single event, it ruined those countries. It's a communist system.
It's what her father, a Marxist, he was a Marxist, it's what her father taught her, from a young girl growing up. She's promising to hand out things she can't deliver. She can never deliver them; she'll never get them approved. Just like when she and Crooked Joe tried to give away student debt. Remember? She wanted to pay. How did that work out? Not too good. The students are saying, ""I love him because of student debt."" But he got rejected.
And this will be rejected even more so because what they're doing is a communist takeover of our country. Her plan is very dangerous, because it may sound good politically, and that's the problem. And we have to be very careful, because when somebody gets up and says, ""We're going to give you everything: $25,000 for a house, we're going to give you all sorts of little goodies, free healthcare, we're going to give you everything, universal healthcare."" Sounds so beautiful.
And I told my people, you got to be very careful. I told the Republican Party; you have to be very careful. She's giving all this away, and somebody that really isn't into it. We're largely, even groups like this, we're into it. We think about it all the time. We want to take back our country. We want to save our country.
And you understand how bad this stuff is? This is communist, this is Marxist, this is fascist. But you know what? It's dangerous because she's saying that she's going to give away things that she'll never be able to get approved.
She wants to increase the number of justices on the United States Supreme Court to 27. 27.[booing] I used to hear she was going up to 11, and then I heard it was 13. But then they said that's an unlucky number, so they went to 15. Yesterday for the first time, I heard 27. We'll have to rebuild the entire Supreme Court, because they won't have enough room for the judges. They won't have enough—.
And by the way, how courageous were our justices of the United States Supreme Court? [cheers and applause] What they did, they're saving our country. They're actually saving our country. What they've done is they've passed things that were so important, and they did it for the right, not for the wrong. They did the right thing. They did the right thing. And I just have such respect for them. The job they've done against—and the radical left plays the ref.
You know the great Bobby Knight? He supported me. He used to fight with the referees all the time. Scream at them.
""Bobby, Bobby, please don't do that. It's not going to work.""
He said, ""You're right, it's not going to work now; it's going to work for the next one.""
And the next call, there'd be a flagrant foul and they wouldn't call it. They didn't want to get screamed at.
The radical left harasses our judges, and harasses our justices. They scream at them. They call them names. They say they're incompetent. They're horrible. They're this, they're that. They should be impeached. They're constantly saying they should be impeached. But they're screaming. And you know what?
It has an effect on some people. But so far, they've been very strong. It's really horrible. I believe it's illegal, what they do. And I'm trying to give you things that you've never heard before, and this is true. I believe they are playing the ref. They're constantly criticizing our great, some of our greatest, justices, and a lot of great judges.
I kept hearing so much about the Florida case, because you know they weaponized our system. Our government totally weaponized it. First time it's ever happened. And they said my biggest case is in Florida, Florida, Florida. We had a very brilliant, I don't know the judge, but a fair and very brilliant judge, who took tremendous abuse. Would've been so easy for her to just rule against me. But she didn't do that. She ruled for—threw out the whole case. [cheers and applause] It was thrown out. That was a big case. And I have such respect for her because she is, in fact, brilliant. But they were hitting her so hard.
""She's going too slow. She's not, she should be removed immediately from office.""
These people are horrible. I really think it's illegal, what they do with judges and justices. They're playing the ref. No different than Bobby Knight. And he was great.
He endorsed me, and Indiana was mine, he was a great coach. He's the last coach to go undefeated. I guess he was like 38—. For some reason, they've never had another college team since then. That was many years ago. And he came out in favor of Donald Trump, and it was a big thing. I won Indiana by a landslide. Because when Bobby Knight from Indiana endorses you, you win. [cheers]
Sort of like when I endorse you, you win too. We have a very good record of endorsement.
But we can't let these radical left thugs constantly scream at our judges and say, ""We're going to impeach him. We're going to take him out of office."" Or her. ""We're going to do horrible things to him."" Continuous.
When you heard Schumer get up on the stairs of the courthouse, Supreme Court, and talk about Kavanaugh, ""We're going to get you, Kavanaugh. We're going to hit you."" Or whatever the hell he said. If a mobster said that, they'd be put in jail immediately. He frankly should have been put in jail, or certainly spoken to very strongly. [cheers and applause] He got lucky. He got lucky. He had a couple of guys that didn't want to do it, and I understand that also. But he got lucky. But we can't let them do that.
And I just want to pay my respect to the judges that have suffered abuse at the hands of the radical left lunatics. And I really admire them for—because you know what? All they have to do to end it is rule against me or whatever it is. If they say, ""Trump, you're guilty."" Oh, now all of a sudden they say, ""Oh."" That's the last time they ever say a bad—but they can't do it, because these people have weaponized the Justice Department, including local DAs and local attorney generals.
And Fani, Fani. You know Fani? Spelled F-A-N-I. ""My name is Fani, F-A-N-I."" I don't figure it. She put a little French accent on the word with her lover, Wade. Right? Lover Wade, we call him, Lover Boy Wade. She hired and paid him almost a million dollars because of his great knowledge of the law. He never did it before.
With us today is Daniel Campos, a pilot in Venezuela who now lives in Pennsylvania. Great gentleman. Daniel came to tell us what you think of Kamala Harris leading our country into socialism. We're being led into socialism, but the socialism will be short-lived. It's going into communism.
If you would've told me, and if you remember many times during State of the Unions, I would say, ""We will never have a socialist country."" And everybody would applaud.
But I was right because we're really, I think, skipping socialism. We're going into communism. When they weaponize our government like this, that's what they do in Third World countries. That's what they do in South American horror shows. That's what they do in banana republics. They've weaponized it.
But I believe ours is even more corrupt. The New York court system is totally corrupt. They use the state and the city to go after me. They take top people in the Department of Justice and put them in.
The Attorney General Leticia James, she campaigned, and, ""I will get Trump!"" And they then go there, and then they go into the Manhattan DA's office. They use Hillary Clinton's lawyer and the Democrats' law firm to leave the firm and go into the DA's office in order to prosecute Donald Trump, free of charge. They're not going to charge.
Then he writes a book, this guy writes a book, before the thing even went anywhere. And in the book he said, ""I do it for free, it's so great."" These are corrupt people, and we have to call them out. So, remember the term, playing the ref with our judges and our justices should be punishable by very serious fines and beyond that. [cheers and applause] But I'd like to ask, because—because we're into that whole system.
And I'd like to call up Daniel. Please come up and tell us about your experience in living in a country that went very, very bad, went radical left, and the experience has not been good. Please come up. Thank you. Hi, Daniel. [cheers and applause]
DANIEL CAMPOS: Thank you. I'm so pleased to meet you.
TRUMP: How are you? Appreciate it. Nice to see you. Please.
CAMPOS: Okay. All right. First of all, hi, everybody. Thank you for coming here and supporting the president. [cheers and applause] I'm going to say the first part of the speech, well, of my story, in English, then I'm going to repeat it in Spanish in order to allow our Latino voters to understand and hear what the situation is going on. [cheers and applause]
First of all, as the president already said, I'm from Venezuela. I left the country in 2007 because of communism. I still have family there. There's been family that has left even before me, or continues leaving little by little. But going farther back, my grandparents from my mom's side were from Cuba.
They were at university when the communist revolution was going on, and they ended up leaving to Venezuela. They only have the money they received for as their wedding present, and they were living in a mid-house, going to school, and trying to move, you know, ahead.
My granddad ended up becoming a doctor, and had a family, raising three children, my mom and my two uncles, when, in the early 1990s, Chavez did a military coup. And right after he run for president, my granddad saw the similarities to what was happening in Cuba, and he told everybody that would listen to him that it was coming. And everybody was like, ""No, this is Venezuela. This is not Cuba. This will never happen to us."" And guess what? It happened to us and has been happening to other Latin American countries as well.
TRUMP: [points down] Right here.
CAMPOS: So when they tell you here, it will never happen, that's not true. We lived it. Now here we are. So, in 2007, we ended up leaving because the socialists and the government, they start changing the education system to make it more like the Cuban education system. It might ring a bell to what's going on here as well. So, it's extremely important for everybody to keep this in mind.
And if you don't mind, I'm going to switch to Spanish for our Latino speakers. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Yeah, good job.
CAMPOS: Thank you.
Para todos latinomericanos, gracias por venir aquí, soportar Presidente Trump.
Es importante que entendamos que lo que ha pasado en otro países en Latinoamerica puede pasar aquí.
Como mencioné, mi abuela—mi abuelos son de Cuba. Se fueron por el comunismo, llegaron a Venezuela sin ninguna base, solo un poco dinero salieron adelante y se—mi abuelo se convirtió en doctor y crió mi madre y mis dos tios.
Cuando Chavez hizo el atentado—perdón—el golpe de estado y duespués corrió por president. Mi abuelo trató de advertir al todo el mundo que eso es exactamente como Cuba. Nadie le hizo cazo. ¿Que paso? Chavez entró y veinte años duespués, aqui estamos.
Tiene que recordar, que si paso en un lugar, puede pasar aquí también. No crean que porque Estados Unidos, gran economia, no puede pasar. Puede pasar y vamos encaminados al menos que tomemos un paso differente y yo por esto pienso que Trump es la major persona para ser lo.
Going back in English, that we are going on a path that is taking us to what Venezuela became, and the only way right now that we can avoid keep going down that path is making Trump president again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. It's a pleasure. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Have you done that before?
CAMPOS: No.
TRUMP: Oh, wow. Thank you, Daniel.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Great.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: What a fantastic job. I said, ""Have you done that before?"" He said, ""No, sir."" You are something. [cheers and applause]
All right. What office is he going to run for? I think we're going to endorse him so fast. [cheers and applause]
Thank you very much.
No, it's such a problem because it's a very dangerous situation. She's giving everybody free everything. It's never going to happen. Remember the college debt, the student debt they were going to give? It never happened. It was just all talk. Then he said, after getting totally rejected—he came up with another plan, which is even dumber.
But what happens is they talk. These things will never happen, but it's very dangerous because politically maybe somebody says, ""Oh, that's great. That's great.""
It's the end of our country. We can't do it. We can't do it. So, I really appreciate that. That was beautiful. That was so well done. Amazing. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
In addition to defeating Kamala Harris, you need to defeat your terrible Democrat Senator Bob Casey. [booing] You know I've been there, I've been in Washington for a long time. I mean, I barely met the guy. Most of these guys I get to meet in one form or another, for better or worse. I hardly know this guy. I never really remember meeting him. He obviously created a great impression. But he's not a hard worker. He's cruising on his father's past. I met the father. I think I knew the father better than I knew the son.
But Bob Casey voted for every bill that caused the worst inflation in the history of our country, in my opinion. They call it decades, but I believe it's the history of our country because they're not using the real things.
Like, mortgage rates went from 2% to 10%. They don't say that. That's inflation. They don't say that. And you can't get any money at 10% either. We had it down to two and 2.4, 2.5%, and now you can't get the money at 10%. They don't have any money.
He voted to open borders and the war on Pennsylvania energy. You know, Bob Casey voted against all of this stuff, against your state, but you don't know because you have other jobs. You're not watching Bob Casey. That's why you need to fire Bob Casey, and you have to elect a man named David McCormick for the U.S. Senate.
Dave is strong on borders, great on taxes. He wants to reduce your taxes.
All my life, I've been involved, usually from the other side, it's called writing checks, but I've been involved. I've made lots of contributions to politicians all my life. And politicians always talked about, ""We will lower your taxes."" That's all they talked about is lowering tax. This is the only group I've ever seen where they say, ""We are going to increase your taxes.""
I've never heard of it before.
And by four times. I gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. And they expire in a few months, and they want to not renew them.
If that's the case, you're going to pay four times the tax that you're paying right now. And then they, on top of that, want to increase your taxes to pay for the green new scam. You know what the green new scam is?
CROWD MEMBER: YEAH
TRUMP: The oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 400 years, but they don't talk about a madman that's building nuclear missiles right now. That's your real global warming. It's not this.
Your global warming is war. Your global warming is going to be nuclear weapons. Nobody talks about that. They don't ever mention it, but they talk about an ocean that's rising, which will give you slightly more beachfront property if it happens.
Now, think of it. But they don't talk about somebody that's got very evil intentions. Look at Iran. I stopped them from building a nuclear weapon, but this guy is going to give it up. [cheers and applause] He's going to give it up.
So, David McCormick. And I've known him for a long time, he's an amazing man, a tremendous education, tremendous military background, and he's a very strong guy, and he loves the state. I really hope you give him a chance.
It's not easy. And I was just talking to him. A guy's been in office for years. He's done nothing. He's done nothing. In that way, it's good, but in another way, it's tough because you've seen his name a little bit. You don't even see his name. Most people don't even know. If you asked, ""Who are the senators?"" they may choose the one that didn't do so well in a debate but won, right? He didn't do too well in a debate. I wonder who did worse in the debate, Biden or him? I think maybe Biden did. I think, actually—
CROWD MEMBER: Fuck Joe Biden!
TRUMP: he's made more sense than a lot of other people over the last few months, in all fairness. He actually has. I commend him on that.
But nobody knows about Casey. Nobody knows about him, even though he's been there for years. His father was there for years. I just want to ask. It's very important because we want to turn our country around.
We need to get great representation even beyond the presidency. And this is a dead seat. It's a seat that voted with this group of people, Barack Hussein Obama, and Biden, and her, because she was a part of it. She's now trying to claim that she has nothing to do with Biden. She had nothing to do with the administration. They put him on. Now, maybe they change it, because I said this a couple of days ago.
Usually, when I say something, they immediately change it so I can't say it anymore, but they gave him speaking on Monday night. Now, have they changed it? I don't think so. Monday night is considered, on a convention, Death Valley. It's Death Valley, because people aren't watching Monday night.
So, they deposed a president. It was a coup of a president. This was a coup.
Nancy Pelosi, Crazy Nancy, she's crazy as a bed bug, Crazy Nancy went in and laid it out. And she never thought he was good, because she's smart, cunning, nasty, mean, but she's crazy. And she went in and she said, ""You're getting out."" And he said, ""No, I'm not. Only God will get me out."" Right? Isn't that what he said? ""Only God."" And within about 24 hours, he announced that he was going to get out. And he won it. He went through a primary system. She didn't. He beat her in the primary. She ran along with 22 people. She ran. She was the first one out because she was no good. She was no good.
And now she's running. And this is not what our country's all about.
And he feels terrible, and he's a very angry man. I watched him yesterday. He's a very angry man. I think he hates them more than he hates Donald Trump, and that's hard to believe. I really do. He's an angry man, and he should be an angry man. They walked in and they stole the presidency of the United States from him. Now, I think he was a terrible president. I think he was the worst president in the history of our country.
I think that Jimmy Carter is the happiest man on Earth today. He's not a young man. Because Jimmy Carter's presidency was brilliant, brilliant by comparison to this. But she was a big part of it, and she's going to be an even bigger part.
Now she wants to give her a whole country away. And just as Daniel and others have said, I mean, its, its—our country's going to die, and yet it's scary because she's given so much away. I mean, who's not going to vote to get some money for House? It's never going to happen. It's trillions of dollars. It's never going to happen. But who's going to vote? I mean, people will maybe vote for this. I said before, it may be good politics, but it's going to destroy our country.
The Washington Post, one of the most evil print journalism, I mean, they've lost a lot of people over the last couple of years, it's nasty, they came out with an editorial excoriating her.
Actually, I spoke with Jeff Bezos just for almost the first time. I met him once before. And he was so complimentary on the way we handled the horrible situation that took place recently, and I appreciated that. But we talked a little bit about the paper. And their radical left paper, they excoriated her in today's editorial. Excoriated her. And I give The Washington Post tremendous credit.
I believe The New York Times did, or is about to do, the same thing. But when they're going after somebody because they're far, far—it's not even left. Every single country that's done this—it's been done many times because it's so easy to say, ""I'm going to give you this. I'm going to give you that. We're going to put price controls on food.""
How do they do that? We're going to say, ""The beans are going to cost this. Cereal's going to—"" It doesn't work. And what happens is you end up with huge inflation and no product because you can't make it anymore, because they lose money hand over fist. So, it doesn't work.
But it's scary because sometimes people vote for it because it sounds good. It sounds good, but it's really bad. We're going to give you tax cuts. [cheers and applause] We're going to give you additional tax cuts. We made our country wealthy. We made our country better than it had ever been before, and we did it. We did it.
The big difference is we had a man serving for three and a half years with her at his side, and we had us. And prior, we did a great job on COVID, never got the credit. I got great credit for the economy, in all fairness to the fake news.
I got great credit for the economy, great credit for the military. We defeated ISIS. We had no new wars. We rebuilt our military. Think of that.
We came up with a new and very important organization, to put it mildly, first time since the Air Force, almost 80 years, Space Force, and we took space, where we were languishing to China, falling way behind China and Russia, we took space, and now we're dominating them. We put some incredible people in there. Space Force has been so important. It'll end up being one of our truly important—already is, I mean, it's coordinating with—but we created Space Force.
We did so many things. Right to Try medically. Right to Try. If you're terminally ill, you had no right to get medicine. Now you sign a document.
They tried to get that for 58 years. 58 years they were unable to get it. I sat everybody down: the labs, the doctors, the insurance companies, and the country, because they didn't want to be sued. Somebody's terminally ill, they take something, they die, and then the family sues them for killing the mother, the father, the sister, the brother. And I said, ""No, you're going to sign a document, and you're not going to sue anybody, but you're going to go home, and you're going to have the greatest drugs in the world that won't be approved for another four or five years."" They're terminally ill. And we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. Thousands. [cheers and applause]
So we did a lot, and we have a lot of other things planned.
Oh, by the way, all of that great work done, we had the greatest lab technicians, the greatest doctors, the greatest laboratories in the world, all of that, under her system, gets wiped out. They're close to a lot of great cures. I worked very hard on that. I also worked very hard on the FDA, getting them to bring it down, bring it down because it was going to take an average of 12 years to get something approved. I got it down to five. I wanted to get it down to two, but things have to happen. But we got it way, way down, and we came up with things.
And we have thousands of people that are living today that were considered terminally ill just a short while ago. It's one of the things I'm most proud—it's called Right to Try. And hopefully, nobody in this room needs it, but if you do, you don't have to go to Asia. You don't have to go to Europe.
Or if you have no money, you go home and you die. That's what happens. Mostly, people don't have any hope. They go home and die. Now you have Right to Try, and thousands of people are living right now that would not be living.
We're also pleased to be joined by a very special man, a friend of mine who's been a warrior from day one, Dan Muser, Congressman Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. Great job. Mrs. Meuser, thank you. What a great job. Thank you. Thank you both for being here. No, I'm telling you, he's been fantastic.
A man who would defend me a lot on fake news, CNN. A former senator from your state, your Commonwealth, who was, frankly, a very talented man. He was very good on television. He spent most of his time defending me. Rick Santorum, former senator. Rick, thank you very much. I appreciate the defense. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Former Congressman Fred Keller. Fred. Thank you very much, doing. The next congressman from Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, Rob Bresnahan. Fred. You look good. You look good. He looks good. Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity. Thank you, Stacy. Great job you're Thank you, Rob. [cheers and applause] Good. Great primary win. I endorsed him. He went through. Great job. That was a big win. Candidate for the 7th Congressional District, Ryan Mackenzie. [cheers and applause Ryan, thank you. Congratulations.
A man who we picked because, unlike a lot of states, including this one, we were leading by a lot, and then, all of a sudden, a miracle happened. We had another miracle happen about four weeks ago too, but this was a big miracle, and they found millions of votes. They found a lot of votes. But they didn't do that in North Carolina where he was the head of the Republican Party. And I said, ""Who is that guy?""
His name is Michael Whatley, and we appointed him the head of the RNC, the Republican National Committee, and he is doing a fantastic job. [cheers and applause Really, really a great job. Thank you very much.
He's going to keep their cheating down to a minimum, right? Maybe nothing, but we know them better. They won't stop. They won't stop. We have an expression, ""Too big to rig,"" right? ""Too big to rig."" [cheers and applause] And we're leading by a lot, even though we now have to run against some—think of it. I spent 100 million.
Now I have to run against somebody else. Is that fair? I think they should reimburse me for the 100 million. Who wants to collect? Does anybody want to go and collect? I'll get Front Row Joe to collect.
The mayor, who's really a wonderful man, by the way. Mr. Mayor, it was good meeting you. Carl Curran. Thank you. Carl. Thank you very much. Thank you, Carl. [cheers and applause] Good man. New York's Broome County DA, Paul Battisti. Paul Battisti. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Paul. Thank you. Good job you're doing. I wish you were in Manhattan. We could use a good one in Manhattan. And Lackawanna County Commissioner Chris Chermak. [cheers and applause] Chris. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. Good job. [cheers and applause]
On my first day back in the Oval Office, I will immediately sign an executive order directing every cabinet secretary and agency head to use every power we have to drive prices down. But we're going to drive them down in a capitalist way, not in a communist way.
At the center of this effort will be to end Kamala's war on American energy, and we will drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to get your energy prices down. We're going to get your energy prices down by 50%. The Kamala presidency will mean death for Pennsylvania energy. Remember that. It'll mean death for Pennsylvania energy.
Kamala imposed a natural gas export ban to cripple Pennsylvania energy producers. You do know that she's against this whole energy thing that you have going, which is by far the most important thing you have from an economic standpoint, a job standpoint. She's against it. Kamala supports a carbon tax on the working class, and she's vowed that she will ban fracking, which means 423, 000 plus at least 150,000 jobs beyond that. Pennsylvania is going to always be fracking because we desperately need the energy, and we desperately need the jobs. [cheers and applause] But she will end it. She will end it.
In addition, your state and local government will be starved of billions of dollars in oil and gas revenue, which means higher taxes, lower property values, worse schools, and plunging quality of life in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that I love. I've spent a lot of time here.
I told you I went to school here, the Wharton School of Finance at Penn. [cheers and applause] Under my leadership, we will make America energy independent and energy dominant, and Pennsylvania energy workers will lead the way. You're going to lead the way. It's big stuff.
To further combat inflation, I will terminate Kamala Harris's green new scam, it's the greatest scam maybe ever played, and rescind all of the unspent funds. We're going to take those unspent funds and use them for roads and bridges, and we're going to give back a lot of money into the Treasury and pay down debt. [cheers and applause]
To make both new and used cars more affordable, I will end the Biden-Harris electric vehicle mandate on day one, one of the most ridiculous things. [cheers and applause] One of the most ridiculous things.
Kamala now claims to want to cut red tape, but in less than four years, she's buried American families in regulations costing a typical household much more than $5,000 per year. Think of that. Just with their red tape.
I will cancel Kamala's crushing regulatory onslaught, and I will immediately eliminate every costly job. Now, just so you know, I cut regulations more than any president in history by far. [cheers and applause By far. So you can't say to me, ""Well, why didn't you do it?"" With me, you can't say that on anything. I did do it, everything I said. They said, ""Promises made, promises kept."" What I said, I kept, I mean, unless there was some crazy thing somewhere. But I got it done. I got it all done.
Even the wall. I built hundreds of miles of wall. [cheers and applause] And I had to fight Congress. I had to fight the Senate like you wouldn't believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall. And I ended up taking it out and winning in court. We had 11 lawsuits by mostly Democrats like Nancy Pelosi. We had 11 different—we won every one of them.
But think of it, I built the wall. I said, ""I'm taking it out of the military because our country's being invaded. This is an invasion of our country."" And we built hundreds of miles of wall. Then we built and had made an extra 200 miles that we were going to use to expand it further than I ever said, and it was made and ready to be installed, and we had a rigged election. And what happened after that was they didn't want to do it, and they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. [booing] 5 cents. Very sophisticated stuff, too.
To get economic relief to workers and families, I will make the Trump tax cuts permanent, and we will have no tax on tips, which she copied. [cheers and applause] She copied.
You all know by now, she came out a few days ago, and she said, ""There will be no tax on—"" I said, ""I said that months ago."" But here's one that she hasn't copied yet, to help seniors on fixed incomes who are suffering the ravages of horrible inflation caused by Crooked Joe and Kamala, there will be no tax on Social Security, so get out— And I get it done. [cheers and applause] I will get it done. They won't. They haven't even promised it to you, but they won't get it done if they do.
And I will always protect Social Security and Medicare for our great seniors, just as I did for four incredible years.
By contrast, Kamala Harris has a three-step plan to destroy Medicare and Social Security. She's going to destroy your Medicare. She's going to destroy your Social Security.
First, she has thrown open our borders.
Second, she is flooding our country with millions and millions of low-wage migrants and giving them welfare: free healthcare, food stamps, public benefits. [booing]
And third, she wants to make them all citizens of the United States. [booing] Many of them coming from prison, many of them coming from mental institutions, and many are terrorists. She wants to make them citizens, dumping them onto Medicare, and dumping them into your beautiful Social Security program.
Remember, for four years, I saved Social Security. I never gave an increase. I never raised the age by five years, which is what they're going to end up doing. With me, it's staying the way it is. We have a lot of ways we're making money. We don't need to take it away from our seniors.
The millions of illegal aliens pouring in under border czar—she was the border czar, right? She was the border czar. Now, about a month ago, she said, ""I wasn't—wasn't the border czar. She was the border czar. But it doesn't matter. She was in charge of the border a hundred percent.
But border czar Harris are coming in from the worst places, some of the most dangerous countries in the world. And as I said, they're emptying out their jails and prisons and they're emptying out their mental institutions and they're dumping them into our country.
What's happening to our country is shocking. It's unacceptable. And we have no choice. We're going to do the largest deportation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
Just this week in Coney Island II, Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a 46-year-old woman, throwing her to the ground and raping her with a knife to her throat. [booing] She thought they were going to kill her. She said, ""They weren't looking to rape me. They were looking to kill me."" And it was a terrible thing.
One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman at a migrant shelter, but he was shielded from deportation by New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala Harris strongly supported and doesn't want to change. [booing]
In Virginia, three weeks ago, a 54-year-old mother of four was leaving a 7/11 when she noticed an illegal alien trying to steal her car. When she tried to stop him, he ran her down and left her dead on the ground before going on to hit two more cars, killing two other drivers.
And in May, the leader of a Peruvian gang known as Los Killers, was released from border patrol custody, and set free into America and Kamala's direct orders, she said, ""Set him free.""
Meanwhile, he was wanted for 23 murders in Peru. Kamala refuses even to call these criminals, and we not going to use the term, she said, illegal aliens. No, they are illegal aliens, but she said, ""Don't ever use that term."" But they're not just illegal aliens, honestly, they're monsters. These are savage monsters. [cheers and applause]
The Harris policy is to let thousands of migrant killers and rapists into our country. She was asked the other day, but she didn't respond. We have detention centers where we have some of the worst criminals in the world in those detention centers from other countries and not just South America. They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from the Middle East.
They come from countries that are seriously crime ridden. And those countries, the crimes are going way down like Venezuela.
We talked about Venezuela or before, and think about Venezuela. Their crime is down 72%. They've gone to Caracas and they've gone to different places in Venezuela. They've taken their murderers, their drug dealers, their rapists, their thugs and they've taken them out of the country. They've said, ""You're going to the United States of America and if you come back, we will kill you."" And they are now living with us. All will be criminals soon.
And don't forget, they're just getting used to the experience of being in a country where criminals are treated better, far better than the people that are being hurt and victimized. [booing] And when they see that and they're going to have levels of crime, I call it migrant crime, we'll call it Kamala migrant crime.
She destroyed San Francisco.
She destroyed Los Angeles.
I call it migrant crime.
She had something that she went with. You're not a criminal. It's a very minor offense if you steal anything from a store that's less than $950, did you know that? So guys are walking into stores with—they walk into stores with a calculator, keep it under 950 and nothing's going to happen. By the way, if it goes to 9,050, nothing happens either. What's happened in California with Governor Newsom and guys like this, people like this is terrible.
But Kamala, but Kamala, what environment, what a beautiful place, what a great place. The weather is so beautiful, the ocean, everything's beautiful. Its crime ridden and horrible and changes have to be made.
The Trump policy is to keep these savage criminals the hell out of our country. [cheers and applause They're going to be out of our country. If Kamala wins, you'll have mass amnesty and citizenship for all. She wants to give all of these people citizenship.
In Venezuela, their crime is down 72%. In other countries all over the world, their crime is way down. And in our country, wait till you see the real numbers because they're not counting migrant crime, which is going to make our crime look like baby stuff.
If I win, you will have the largest operation of police to take care of us. They have to take care of us. They want to take care of us. They want to do their job. [cheers and applause] As border patrol wants to do their job and it's going to start on inauguration day, January 20th, 2025. It's going to start immediately. [cheers and applause]
They want to do their job and we don't let them. And if they do their job and if they're a little bit strong about doing their job, they're dealing with a lot of very tough people. They take away their pension, they take away their job, they lose their family, they lose their house, they lose everything. They end up in squalor. And we're not going to do that.
We're going to defend our great local police and law enforcement. In general, we're going to defend them. [cheers and applause] We're going to defend them.
We want them to protect us and we're going to need them much more than ever before because the criminals pouring into our country by the millions. I believe the real number is over 20 million people. You don't hear that. 10 million, 12 million, even if it was, it's still so many. But the real number is over 20 million people. That's larger than New York state.
Kamala Harris wants to eliminate private health insurance and give free taxpayer funded healthcare to every single illegal alien in the country. [booing] And then you wonder why do they come up? You know why they come up? Because guys like Newsom and others are saying, ""Come up, come to our country. We'll give you healthcare."" You know what they're doing to your school system is incredible. People are taking the seats of your children. Your children can't go to school.
And you have people taking their seats that don't speak a word of English, come from a foreign country and your kids aren't getting educated. Your kids are not getting educated. They're considered like secondary citizens. And this is Kamala and Joe to a lesser extent.
Look, Joe, Joe's lost. He's—forget him.
By contrast, I'm going to keep the Affordable Care Act unless we can do something much better. We'll keep it, but we can do much better. It's too expensive for the people. They can't afford it. It's lousy healthcare. If we can do something better, we're working on it. If we can do something better, but we will never let anybody touch it unless we have something better.
We're going to deliver lower prices, lower drug costs, and new options that will dramatically reduce the crushing burden on all American patients.
And Kamala and Crooked Joe, they try and take credit for $35 insulin, but I was the one that did the $35 insulin, not them. [cheers and applause]
Just kicked in during their administration. I remember a couple of years, a few years ago, I said, ""Boy, oh boy."" They said, ""Sir, this will kick in over the next two and a half, three years."" I said, ""What about now?"" You couldn't do it, just to process. I said, ""I hope I win the presidency because I want to get credit for that."" But he gets up there, ""Oh, we got $35."" I got it.
Kamala Harris,' Democrat Party is the party of healthcare for illegals. The Republican Party is the party of common sense. We really are the party of common sense ultimately. [cheers and applause]
So we will bring back our supply chain, the supply chains, and they've been so devastated. Our supply chains are— You order something and they say, ""Sir, that'll be four months."" And then four months comes up and they say it's going to be another four months. It's stuck at sea. They have no idea where the hell it is.
But we're going to bring them back from China and other foreign countries ending costly supply chain disruptions. And they are really bad. There is bad now as they were—but we get used to it. We're living like a third-world country. Who thought?
As we reduce burdens on domestic manufacturers, American workers will make our critical goods better and cheaper right here in the USA and right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
And I will, with David, revoke China's most favored nation's trade status. You know, hey have a huge advantage. Because they are a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. We're a nation that is crippled. We are a horribly crippled nation. And China gets all of these advantages in trade because they consider themselves to be a growing nation. Well, we're a growing nation too. And I did that already.
I will pass what will be known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country makes us pay 100 or 200% tariff, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff of 100 or 200% right back.
You hurt us, we hurt you. It's called an eye for an eye.
I will also restore peace through strength and I will prevent World War III from happening. We will stop it. [cheers and applause]
When crooked, Hillary Clinton was running against me. She said, ""Look at him. Listen to him. He will start a war, a world war.""
We had no wars other than I defeated ISIS in its entirety, 100% of the ISIS caliber.
""Listen to his rhetoric. Listen to his horrible tone."" I said that horrible tone is going to keep people from fighting us, and that's what happened.
We had no wars.
It's been 81 years since that happened for a president.
No wars other than ending some wars that we are in and defeating ISIS. Two days ago, I watched a parade of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Did you see it? The Taliban were—they were showing all of our equipment that they took from America, $85 billion worth, two days ago, celebrating three years of the defeat of America by these guys.
And I knew them very well. Abdul was the head. Abdul was not playing games with me. They were executing a lot of our soldiers. And I spoke to him. I said, ""Abdul, don't do it anymore. There'll be no more.""
Anyway, I said it pretty tough. And you know what? For 18 months we didn't have one American soldier killed in Afghanistan. [cheers and applause]
And then I left. And then I left.
And this bunch of incompetent people took over and it all started up again. And then they had the most embarrassing day in the history of our country, I thought. But she bragged about being the last person in the room that night, the night that they decided to do whatever they decided to do. In other words, she had the final vote and she bragged about it. It's been the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan. It should have never, ever happened. We should have gotten out with dignity and strength.
And you don't take your military out first. You take your military out last. They couldn't believe we did it.
Under Trump, we will have no more wars, no more disruptions, and we will have prosperity and peace for all. And again, we're going to bring back that American dream for all of the young people in this audience and some of the old ones.
This is how we will end the era of inflation, mayhem and misery under Kamala and crooked Joe Biden and unleash safety, prosperity, and promise for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Every single one of them are going to understand peace and wealth. And we're going to be a dominant force again. We're going to be respected as a country again. Right now, we're being laughed at that. [cheers and applause]
Together we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation.
We had almost no inflation during my four years, almost nothing. And they went up to nine and a half percent. And that number's a fake number because they don't add the worst categories. It was much higher than that. But it was record setting inflation that everyone can—we're going to make sure—afford your groceries, afford a car, afford a home, low interest rates.
We're going to get it all down. We will stop the invasion. We will end migrant crime. We'll support our great police. We will strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield over the top of our country, an iron dome. It'll be a great iron dome and much of it will be made right here in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]
Why shouldn't we have that? Why shouldn't we have that? Other countries can have it, but we can't. It was our idea.
Ronald Reagan wanted it many years ago. But then in all fairness, you didn't have the technology. Today, you do. We're going to have an iron dome to protect us from the lunatics out there.
And we're going to keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools and we are going to keep men out of women's sports.
No men in women's sports.
Did you see in the Olympics? They had two transitioned. They transitioned. Uh they were men. They transitioned to women and they were in the boxing.
And a young Italian woman was boxing one of the transitioned men. And she got hit with a jab. [mimes punching] Just boom. A jab is not like the hard—this is the harder one, right? If you're right-handed. Boom. And she backed up. She said, ""What just hit me. I just got hit with a horse. What just hit me?"" Think of that. Then he did it again. Boom. And she said, ""Okay, that's enough."" Two jabs. Then the other one—and by the way, he went on to easily win the gold medal. He just walked through everybody. [booing] He won the gold medal.
Then there was another one, a transitioned man, and he also won the gold medal. He transitioned and he won the gold medal very easily. So the two fighters won the gold medals very easily. And she came out, the Italian girl, beautiful girl, very good boxer. And she said, ""Nobody's ever hit me like that."" Two jabs. She said, ""I've never been hit."" She just said, ""That's enough. That's enough.""
It's crazy. It's so demeaning to women. How about the weightlifting? Hundreds of pounds more hundreds. Records that haven't been broken in 18 years. One eighth of an ounce here, one eighth of an ounce. And they can't do it. You could do it. They can't do it. And a guy comes out, excuse me, a transitioned person. How much more is that? Oh, that's 128 pounds more. How crazy is this? Our country has gone crazy and we're going to put it back on track. We are the party of common sense. [cheers and applause]
We will defend the Second Amendment, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections.
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive.
We're going to be a thriving country again.
And every day we'll be filled with joy, opportunity, and hope. Right now, it's filled with sorrow. It's sorrow.
People are so embarrassed by what's happening to our country. They're waiting for Iran to drop weapons all over Israel. But it hasn't happened. You know why? Because our country is willing to pay them billions and billions of dollars. How about where they negotiate? I had 58 people; we negotiated and we didn't pay. 58 hostages I got out. 59 I think, and got them out even from North Korea, the toughest.
Had a good relationship with Kim Jong-Un. But I got them out. But you never pay because once you pay, you got to pay. How about we pay $6 billion, 6 billion and we get some out.
And in the case of Russia, they get the Prince of Doom. You know who the Prince of—the greatest arms dealer, they say in the history of the world and they got him. And we also gave $6 billion. It's so embarrassing. And the world is watching. And when you pay $6 billion, all of a sudden people are going to be disappearing from the streets all over the place. And it's a very bad precedent is being set in many ways, including the weaponization of our government.
I could have done that with Hillary Clinton. And I said to myself, ""How would it look? We're trying to unify the country. How would it look if I had arrested and put in prison the wife of the President of the United States?"" I thought it was not good. And then they do that to me. They want to put me away. But you know what? I get indicted for you. To me, I'm just here. I'm just standing in their way. [cheers and applause]
I said to them, ""Fellas, you know—"" I was no fan of Hillary, but I said, ""How would it look if we put her in prison? We're going to put Hillary Clinton, the wife and a Secretary of State. We're going to put her in prison?"" But we never did this stuff. And then I came along. It's double standard. They do. They want to do it to me. So far, they've been very unsuccessful. But they would like to.
We must defeat Kamala Harris and we must stop her country destroying liberal agenda, liberal like nobody's ever seen in the history of our country. So get your friends, get your family register, volunteer. Get out and vote and vote for that guy right there, David. [cheers and applause]
The radical left Democrats rigged the presidential election in 2020 and we not going to allow them to rig the presidential election in 2024. [cheers and applause]
And we want a landslide.
Not going to let it happen.
We're not going to have a country left. You need two things to start. You need a strong, beautiful, fair border and you need fair and free elections. And we have neither, right? [cheers and applause]We have neither.
On November 5th, we will save our economy. We will rescue our middle class. We will reclaim our sovereignty and restore our borders. We will put America first and we will fight, fight, fight. We're going to fight. We're going to fight for our country. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
But this is a very consequential commonwealth as we say. But this is a very consequential vote in Pennsylvania because they say that if you win Pennsylvania, you're going to win the whole thing. [cheers and applause]
We cannot let these people win Pennsylvania. That includes David. Can't let it happen.
And together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make it powerful, powerful.
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. [cheers and applause] We will make America safe again.
We will make America free again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause]

TRUMP: Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] That's beautiful. This is quite a place. It's an honor to be here at Precision Custom Components, a company that has helped to build and defend America for over 150 years. That's really an extraordinary achievement.
I want to thank you, President Gary Butler and the members of the wonderful Butler family, members of Congress, Scott Barry, and GT Thompson. You're here someplace in this very big factory, wherever you may be. There you are. Great people, great warriors I will tell you.
My trade representative ambassador, Robert Lighthizer, who's fantastic at a thing called trade. We did very well at trade and you were fantastic. And I want to thank you, Bob, very much. And chair of the York County Commissioners, Julie Wheeler. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Julie, very much. Thank you. And a very special congratulations to all of the people of York County today who are celebrating the 275th anniversary of York County's founding. That's pretty good. [cheers and applause] That beats most of them out there.
But most of all, let me thank the exceptionally skilled and talented workers with us in this room. I know you well. I know them from all over the country they come and they are the most talented people and the most brilliant people in so many respects. So thank you all very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
For generations, the handwork of Precision Custom Components has strengthened the spine of America. Your products have gone into the Hoover Dam and atomic energy plants, nuclear submarines, and they currently are doing a lot of work.
I'm here today to deliver a simple message. When I'm back in the White House, America's future will be built right here in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And it will be built by American workers like you. Be all over the country will be building, but Pennsylvania is always a big factor. And we've had great success, as you know, politically and otherwise in Pennsylvania. And we expect to have it again. We're doing very well here. Thank you very much.
With your vote, we will unleash explosive economic growth and vast due prosperity for all of our citizens. We will put more money into your pockets and create millions and millions of new jobs. Gonna do it like nobody else has ever been able to do it. Our plan will massively cut taxes, unlock American energy slash regulations, big factor, crack down on trade cheaters and stop outsourcing, rebuild our industrial base and bring back those beautiful words ""Made in the USA."" [cheers and applause]
And we were doing that four years ago and starting to do really well. And then we had to stop for an unknown reason. Together we will reclaim our nation's destiny as the number one manufacturing superpower in the world. We will do it and China won't even be close. Nobody will be. We had that going at a level that nobody's seen before and we're going to have it going again even better. And this firm and this people standing behind me and in front of me will be a big factor.
Every policy in Kamala Harris's radical Liberal playbook sends jobs and wealth to other countries. [booing] The jobs go to other countries and the wealth goes to other countries. Every policy in the Trump agenda is designed to bring the jobs and wealth back home to America where it belongs and where it's going to stay. Kamala puts America last. I put America first. [cheers and applause]
Some facts that are interesting. The year before I took office, the United States lost over 10,000 manufacturing jobs. Everybody said you'd never bring it back. But under my leadership, we created more than a half a million manufacturing jobs in less than three years. After decades of wage stagnation and income surged, we had a surge like nobody's ever seen before, but it surged for everybody during the Trump administration, every group, everybody, men, women. We had every household was at a level that they've never really experienced before. The typical American household saw their incomes grow by more than $4,200 per year. Everyone was better off when you had a gentleman named President Donald J. Trump at the helm. Does anybody know him,—[cheers and applause] whoever he may be? I kept every single promise I made to the workers of Pennsylvania and to every other place within our country.
On day one, I withdrew from the unfair job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And if I didn't do that, you wouldn't be open right now. You wouldn't have a job. That was a big thing. It was approved by another president who would've destroyed our manufacturing in this country still further.
I imposed historic tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel and numerous other things that were unfair to our country and unfair to our workers. I ended the total disaster known as NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made by this country, and replaced it with the brand new USMCA. That's Mexico and Canada, the best trade deal ever made by our country, although I will tell you that I think the deal with China was probably even better. They had to buy $50 billion worth of our product, but after Covid, I don't even talk about that anymore, $50 billion they had to buy, and they were buying it too.
I stood up to China like never before, bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars when no other president had gotten literally 10 cents from China, brought in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, never happened before. Nobody else literally got 10 cents.
We passed the largest tax cuts in history, the largest regulation cuts in history, and built the greatest economy of the history of the world. We were at a level that nobody had ever seen before, and now we're going to do it again, but we're going to do it even bigger, better, stronger, and smarter.
When I left office, I handed Kamala and crooked Joe Biden a surging economy with no inflation. You had no inflation. You had—Everything was good, great wages, no inflation. Now, you have inflation at levels that I don't believe anyone's ever seen before.
The 30-year mortgage rate was 2.6%, but it was actually closer to 1.9 if you look at it the way that most people look at it. And gasoline had reached and was basically at levels of $1.87 a gallon, but we had months and moments where it was even less than that. Wouldn't that be nice, $1.87, Gary? [steps away from podium] That would be very nice. The family likes it more than Gary. Gary's been around too long. The family likes it more.
Our economic future, it never looked brighter. When Kamala and Biden came in, they quickly blew it all up. Destroyed. 350,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. Did you know that? I keep hearing about their economy. Their economy's terrible, and the inflation is eating everybody alive, and it's been doing that for three years.
The no inflation or almost no inflation, it kept going during the early part of this administration, this current administration, but it ended very quickly, and then it went to levels, and so quickly, it went so fast, and it was a shame. It was all blown up and destroyed, and jobs were lost. A lot of jobs were lost. Our country is doing really badly under them, and nobody wants to talk about it. The media doesn't like talking about it, because the Democrats, they really protect themselves. It's pretty amazing. Someday, the media is going to become real media instead of fake media, and you're going to see a big difference in the country. [cheers and applause]
Real incomes are down $2,000 a year since she took office. Kamala casts the tie-breaking votes that gave us the worst inflation in American history costing a typical family $28,000. Under Kamala, we have fallen into manufacturing recession with 13,000 manufacturing jobs lost in the United States since just the start of this year.
I don't know if you all know that, but that's what's happened. And it'll happen here, and it'll happen in this plant. It'll happen everywhere. If she gets in, if Kamala gets in, the United States will rapidly become a de-industrialized third-world nation like so many others have become.
She's running on socialist price controls, banning gas-powered cars and trucks, and private health insurance policies are gone. She wants to defund the police, abolish cash bail. She wants to abolish it immediately, cash bail. She wants to abolish ICE, get rid of the incredible brave patriots of ICE who take MS-13 gang members, probably the worst gang anywhere in the world, horrible situation. They take them out, and they take them out bravely. They're strong. They're fierce, and they love our country. She wants to give free healthcare for millions of illegal aliens, and give them all citizenship into the United States immediately.
She then wants to sign them up for Medicare and Social Security, and she wants them to vote illegally if possible, any way they can vote. They don't care if it's illegal or not, [booing] and they're signing people up as we speak. They're signing them up as we speak. They don't care. They don't care about the laws. Very simply, Kamala Harris is an economy wrecker and a country destroyer. Our country will be destroyed if she gets in. Her radical liberal agenda ruined San Francisco. It ruined California when she was the Attorney General. It crushed our middle class, demolished our border, set the world on fire, and now she wants to be promoted to the job killer in chief, but much more than job killer.
Everything else is going to go bad. She set the standard in California. Think of this. If you steal $950 or less, they're going to leave you alone. They can't be bothered. So, you see criminals going into stores with a little computer adding it up, everything they've stolen. They want to stay under the 950, but they don't get prosecuted for above that. The only one that gets prosecuted is somebody who would talk about the unfair election. They get prosecuted.
But when you steal and rob and kill and so many other things, when you sell drugs and destroy people's lives, nothing happens to you under Kamala, but we will not let this happen. We're not going to let it happen to our country. 78 days from now, Pennsylvania is going to tell her that we've had enough, that we can't take it anymore. Comrade,—[cheers and applause] comrade, Kamala, Harris, you are fired. Get out. You're not doing the job. Get out. [cheers and applause] You are fired.
While Biden and Harris have been impoverishing our country, they have been getting rich, very rich at your expense. Now, it just came out, just was reported today by a great young reporter, Brooke Singman at Fox. According to a 292-page report from the House Oversight Judiciary on Ways and Means Committees in Congress, just got out a little while ago just before I got here.
I said, ""No, I want to talk about it just briefly."" It's so sad, because he's going to be making his speech tonight, and they don't call him crooked Joe for no reason. They said, ""President Biden engaged in impeachable conduct, and said he abused his office and defrauded the United States of America to enrich his family.""
Republicans revealed that since 2014, the Biden family and its associates received more than $27 million from foreign individuals and entities. They also found that while Biden was serving as vice president, the Biden family got more than $8 million in loans from Democrat benefactors, and they said that those loans have never been repaid. Those are the best kind of loans, aren't they?
This report says in part that Vice President Biden actively participated in this conspiracy by, among other things, attending dinners with his family, foreign business, partners, and speaking to them by phone, often being placed on speakerphone by Hunter Biden. Republicans are calling out a 2014 dinner that Hunter Biden and his family attended with a Russian oligarch. They said that after that dinner, that oligarch wired $3.5 million to Hunter Biden's firm very quickly. It was a very quick wiring. I'm sure he worked very hard for the money. Several witnesses testified that Hunter Biden invoked his father in business dealings with Romanian, Chinese, Kazakhstani, and Ukrainian companies in addition to other companies and people, resulting in millions and millions of dollars flowing into the Biden family.
As everybody knows, $3.5 million was sent from the mayor of Moscow, the mayor of Moscow's wife. Remember, I brought that up in the debate I had. I said, ""Why did this happen?"" And the anchor wouldn't let me ask that question. They thought it was inappropriate, but then it blew up. $ 3.5 million dollars was sent by the mayor of Moscow's wife to the family. They were also calling out Biden for his handling of classified documents. They said during his tenure as vice president, Joe Biden removed highly sensitive classified documents from the White House, despite having no authority to do so.
And remember, comrade Kamala, she knew everything, and the senators knew what was going on. By the way, I had my own classified documents case,—and I was totally exonerated, totally. [cheers and applause]
It was a case brought by Joe Biden and Kamala. She was involved. They did that in order to interfere with the election, and it still goes on different cases, but that was according to most the big one, and we were totally exonerated. The case was won a month ago. Very little coverage of the case being won, I must say. I think that a lot of the media didn't even talk about it.
There's no way someone could have stolen that much money without Democrat senators knowing what was going on. He wined and dined them at Joe's houses. They saw his boats. They saw the way he lived. They saw his beautiful mansions.
I would've made billions of dollars in this job if I wanted to play that game the way they played it, but instead, I took the job very seriously and very importantly. And you can see from the recently announced financial reports, I don't need the money, and I'm proud to announce that doing and being president, I lost billions of dollars, and I knew that would happen. Maybe not quite as much as that, but I'm satisfied with that, because we want to make America great again. That's much more important. We have to make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Though, I could have played it the other way. I could have made so much. I see some of my friends over here. I could have made so much.
No, I didn't want to do that. This is too important. This is too big a thing. We got to save our country, because our country is really in big trouble. We're a nation in decline.
We're going down the drain. The drain is the swamp that you've heard so much about. They get rich, and in Washington, some of these politicians, what they're doing to our country is disgraceful, but he's one of the leaders of the pack. You have others.
The number one step we will take to launch a great American manufacturing renaissance will be to end Kamala Harris' war on American energy. It's a war, and you do know that inflation was caused by her cutback on energy. Then what they did is they, in a panic, move shortly thereafter when the numbers for gasoline, oil, and electricity and everything else that comes from energy and out of energy.
When they started going through the roof, they immediately went back to the Trump plan, but what they didn't go back to is my plan would've been doubled, tripled, and even quadrupled from the numbers I had four years ago. They didn't do that. They brought it back to a similar, because they were getting just absolutely destroyed by the numbers. It was going up, and you can bet that if we don't win, she takes over. Your energy numbers will be triple and quadruple, and you won't be producing a drop of oil.
They ended the largest oil reserve anywhere in the world, probably as large as Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia has this massive amount of oil. It's called ANWR in Alaska. They ended it on close to day one. They ended it. Ronald Reagan couldn't get it. No other president got it. I got it, and it's bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia most likely.
They seem to think biggest in the world they've been after. They've been after getting that approved for many, many decades. Ronald Reagan worked so hard to get it. He couldn't get it. I got it, and then they ended it.
They were just set to start drilling. Everything was done, and he came into office. He ended it. On day one, I will tell the frackers and energy workers of Pennsylvania to drill, baby, drill, —[cheers and applause] and she's totally a non-fracker. You know that. Until a few months ago, she said, ""Oh."" It's just like on tips. We're not going to tax tips. All of a sudden, she comes out and she says the same thing, exactly the same words that I used months later, and other things she said, like trying to copy my policy, but it takes much more than copying a policy, because they're never going to produce it anyway.
Our country's going to be in serious trouble, but she was a non-fracker, no fracking under any circumstances. She's like 100 times saying, ""I will not frack."" Look at her debates. There will be no fracking. There will be no —
Then a few months ago, she said, ""Oh, we'd love to frack with a politician."" They go back to their original thought. There will be no fracking if she's elected in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. You'll have energy that will go up three, four, five times.
You'll be paying $10 a gallon for gasoline, and a lot higher than that. Unleashing American energy will reduce prices, launch record-setting economic growth, create millions and millions of jobs, and produce higher wages for the American worker.
You can't be a manufacturing powerhouse unless you have low-cost energy. We will have low-cost energy. [cheers]
Electricity rates for a Chinese factory are more than 50% lower than the price of electricity for an American factory, and we were working four years ago at really getting it along, and then we were hit with uh? The Covid came in. We focused on that. We did a great job.
If we didn't do a great job in that, we would've been in a depression like in 1929, which is where you're heading if she gets in. You're heading for the depression of 1929, that type. That's called the big league depression.
Since Kamala took office, electricity prices in America up much more than 30% nationwide, and here in Pennsylvania, they're expected to increase by another 30%. They think it's going to be actually unsustainable for your state if she gets in. It's not sustainable. It's not sustainable for the country. That's why I've declared that a top priority for my administration will be to cut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office. [cheers and applause]
So, we'll cut it in half. I think we'll be able to do better than that. We're going to be cutting it in half, guys.
That'll help you a little bit [inaudible].
CROWD MEMBER: Absolutely.
TRUMP: I think we'll do that very quickly. That includes heating, air conditioning, electricity, and gasoline. Your bills will be less than half. When you look at the New England area, they pay some of the highest energy anywhere in the world because they can't put a pipeline in. They've been restricted from putting a pipeline in through a certain section of New York that is desperately wanting it.
They need the job so badly. And if they did that in New England, the prices would come down half just with the pipeline alone. They were getting their gasoline and their energy from a place called Russia. Ships would pull up on the east coast, Russian ships, and that's where New England got it from, and they were paying a big price. And to this day, they're paying the highest prices, but we'll take care of that.
We think energy costs, all of it, air conditioning, heating, all of it, including gasoline, will drop by more than 50% within the first 12 months. [cheers and applause]
So remember that. That includes for factories. [cheers and applause]
This will help us quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again. By contrast, Kamala Harris wants to ban fracking. She supports a national carbon tax, which is a horrible tax that will destroy many businesses, that will have a huge impact on this business, but that will destroy a carbon tax. Nobody even knows what it is. Nobody knows how to calculate it. And she imposed a natural gas export ban, all catastrophic things for Pennsylvania. [booing]
That means all the income coming in. For the most part, you'll have none of it. You'll lose 500, 000 jobs and you won't have the income coming up. That means Pennsylvania is going to have to pay, your commonwealth, your beautiful commonwealth is going to have to pay numbers that nobody ever thought even possible or worth discussion.
Kamala is also on a regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America. Now, Germany tried it just a couple of years ago and they ended up getting rid of their political leaders very quickly, and now they're building probably 50 or 60 power plants currently, and they're looking to build a lot more. But they got rid of everything and they wanted to go to wind and solar and lots of other things. Unfortunately, it didn't work.
They couldn't fire up the plants. The plants were closed and they couldn't get them going, and now they've gone to the other extreme. They've gone back to fossil fuel, I hope clean fossil fuel, clean coal. They do have clean coal. They have coal that actually has to make your electricity. And if you didn't have fossil fuel, you wouldn't have electricity because that's where it comes from originally. And you can have very clean and efficient natural gas.
At least 50 existing power plants have closed since she took office, Kamala took office. They're closing them all over the country. They're closing nuclear. They're closing coal. They're closing everything. We're not going to have —
That's why in California, you have blackouts all the time, constant blackouts, and yet they want to go to all-electric cars. Let's go to all-electric cars, even though we don't have enough electricity to give it ourselves some cool and some heat in the summers and the winters.
I'm announcing today that when I return to the White House, I will end the anti-American energy crusade and terminate Kamala's so-called power plant rule. It's a disaster for our country.
Our country will have no jobs by the time these communists and Marxists get rid of—I mean when they—when they destroy the country, probably can never come back either, just so you understand. Too much competition from other countries that are doing it right. We have a lot of competition out there. Not only China, we have a lot of other competition.
Instead of shutting down power plants, we will open dozens and dozens more, and they'll happen fast. Kamala stands for energy disappearance and factory obliteration. She will obliterate factories like this.
I stand for American energy independence and manufacturing dominance. We're going to be dominant in manufacturing. We're going to be dominant in energy too, not just um getting it to take care of ourselves. We're going to be selling it all over the world. We're going to be reducing our debt. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further.
Don't forget I gave you the largest tax cut in history. We're going to be lowering your taxes still further. Upon taking office, I will do rapid approvals for new energy infrastructure, and we will embrace all forms of energy including nuclear.
Nuclear is a great energy.
This plant is making some things that I just got to see, and it's incredible what you've done, what Gary and the family have done. The level of complexity, the level of detail, the power that we're talking about is incredible to power our country into the future, including the electricity demands of AI and cryptocurrencies, which is a very big subject. It's coming up more and more, and we have to stay at the top. We want to be right at the forefront.
Otherwise China and other countries will take it over. That's both of them, AI and crypto.
We will make a historic commitment to bring in advanced small modular nuclear reactors online, building these massive plants that cost $20 billion and don't even get built like we had recently in a couple of other states. I won't mention the states, but they had two plants that got so out of control with cost overruns, massive, massive nuclear plants. Now we're going to do small reactors, small nuclear, we call it.
France does that. France does very well with that. They do small. And if they need more, they build a second one, a third one, a fourth one. They hook them up together. With the help of companies like yours, these can be built ultra safe. They're ultra clean, and they're very low cost, but they are absolutely safe. Under Kamala's green new scam, billions and billions of taxpayer dollars are being sent to subsidize solar panel factories, windmill factories, battery production and car production all based in China.
We are subsidizing massive amounts of product for solar, for wind. It's all made in China.
Under the Trump administration, we will build American, buy American, and hire American. [cheers and applause]
That's what we're going to be doing. Kamala's economic agenda rewards outsourcers and punishes American workers by making it economically impossible to manufacture in America.
What I'm promising today is a total pro-American overhaul of our tax regulation and trade systems to promote domestic production and punish those who ship jobs and factories overseas or to places like Mexico, where right now, the head of the United Auto workers doesn't know this. They're building some of the biggest car factories, just started, anywhere in the world. The person I know builds car factories. That's all he does, build car factories.
He said the biggest ones in the world are being right now in Mexico. And they think they're going to bring those cars in, make them in Mexico, bring them in here, and sell them to our people and destroy Detroit and the rest of our car business. They've already taken 30% before I got there, 30%.
They did nothing against us when I was there. I told them, ""If you want to build car factories, you're going to have to pay a 100% tariff to get the car into this country."" They immediately said, ""Well, I guess we're not going to build a car factory."" Right? That's what happened, but now they're building the biggest in the world right in Mexico, and they think they're going to take our car.
They're not going to do that if I'm here because I will be putting massive tariffs on those cars coming across the border, and it won't make any economic sense. So I actually think they should stop building them unless they want to sell those cars to another country.
Kamala wants no taxes on Chinese producers, wants no taxes. What's that all about? While imposing the largest tax hike in the history of our country on factories in the United States.
Okay, so she wants a no tax policy on China, but she wants to tax factories like this and other factories at levels that they've never seen before. Under her plan, manufacturers will pay even higher taxes in America than in Communist China. By contrast, I will pass gigantic tax cuts for workers and keep their jobs here in the United States. They're going to stay here. [cheers and applause]
We're going to beat everybody. We're going to beat them like a drum. [cheers and applause]
And we were doing that against China. There was a long-time expression that China will take over the world's largest economy. It'll take it over in 2019. Well, in 2019 we were doing so well, 2018, 2017, that China never even came close. We were lapping them. They never came close.
And even President Xi said congratulations. They thought they would be—long time, this is 15, 20 years ago, they said, ""2018, 2019, China will dominate."" Nope, we were doing—It would never happen.
In fact, I said after we started really doing it, as long as we have smart presidents, they'll never catch us because they can't beat our system.
We will have big tax cuts for families and small businesses, and we will have no tax on social security and no tax on tips. [cheers and applause]
So they haven't copied Social Security yet, but they will. Don't forget, he's the one that destroyed our seniors with inflation. Inflation has destroyed our seniors. It's the worst thing that could happen.
The people that behaved the best that did it the American way, that saved their money, they got decimated because their money went down because they couldn't live. They were losing money. With me, they were putting money in the bank and making a lot of money. They were saving a lot of money. After I left, they were losing all of that money they saved.
Kamala wants to spend $1.7 trillion in wasteful spending, causing more inflation. And she says it's a mistake to ask her how she's going to pay for it.
""Please, it's a mistake."" She just said it. She just said something that nobody has any idea what she said, but she said it's a mistake to ask how we're paying for it. Kamala Harris can't answer how she'd pay for any of her new radicalized liberal spending schemes that will bankrupt our country, and do it quickly, destroy social security, destroy Medicare.
She has no clue how'd she pay for $25,000 to every first-time home buyer, including illegals, just like they were going to pay the bills of college students. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and won't happen. They gave up that. Supreme Court gave it up because it was unfair to all of those people. One of the reasons, all of the people for years and years that paid back their loans, and now we're going to give something free, but it didn't happen. It was just talk. He knew it wouldn't happen too. Crooked Joe, he knew that was not going to happen.
No clue how she'd pay for free healthcare for illegals. She wants to give free healthcare to illegals.
Now, you want to stop people from coming into our country, the first thing you do, and you would have to do this immediately, no healthcare. We can't do that. We can't afford it. It's not sustainable, but they're doing it. Just the opposite. Come to America. Live the American dream. We'll give your children free schooling. We'll give you free healthcare. We'll give you pensions. We'll put you into social security. This is why people are pouring into our country—in the caravans. That's a very dangerous trip. Thousands and thousands of people are dying in those caravans coming up to our country, and they're coming up because the promises are being made to them that just can't be kept.
No clue how she'd pay for the $100 trillion, think of that 100 trillion with a T, dollar green new scam. It's a scam. Out of the $100 trillion, you wouldn't—There's not $1 of it that would help our country, not $1 of it.
It'll destroy our country. And no clue how she'd pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in new foreign aid giveaways. We're giving away money at levels that nobody has ever seen before. No other country would do it. No other country would be so stupid to do it.
That's why it's so important to vote for Trump to stop the reckless spending and the destruction of our country. We will not have a country left. I will stop the special interest giveaways, cut waste, and restore common sense to our government. The Republican Party is the Republican Party of common sense. [cheers and applause]
That's what it is. Kamala will bury American workers in regulations. I will liberate our workers with the largest regulatory cuts ever recorded. We've already done some of them, but she put them right back. They put them right back. Repealing every single job killing regulation of the Biden-Harris administration. The electric vehicle mandate, which is absolutely so crazy, will be gone, and there will be no costly forced transition to all electric cars and trucks.
If you want a gasoline propelled car or a hybrid or an electric car, they're wonderful too, but not all. People need to go longer distances. They want to pay less money. Fantastic. Electric is fantas—Everything is great. You have to be able to buy everything.
They have a mandate. We don't have enough of electricity for ourselves, and now they're talking about putting all the cars on it. Well, it doesn't work because the cars don't go far.
If you'd like to go from here to, let's say Washington to look after we fix the capital up and make it safe again, which will take approximately like quickly,—but after we fix it up, and if you want to drive there, you don't want to stop five times, you want to be able to go there and you want to be able to enjoy it, and you don't want to be mugged or shot or killed in our capitol, which has become very unsafe. It's horribly run, graffiti stained, and we're going to fix it very quickly and beautifully. We're going to make it the most beautiful capitol anywhere in the world, and we're going to make it totally safe. Police are going to do a great job.
Simultaneously, we will modernize our trade policies. The United States has long been taken advantage of by other countries at levels that nobody has any idea. I would sit and look at these trade deals, many of which we renegotiated with Japan, with South Korea, with Canada, Mexico, many. But I'd look at these deals before we did the renegotiations and say, ""Who would make deals like this?"" I mean, they were either crooked or really stupid, one or the other, probably crooked for the most part because I don't think they're stupid. But we had the worst trade deals.
No country's ever had trade deals like. We fixed many of them, made some of them extraordinary. We lose jobs in revenue.
They gain everything. We lose jobs. We lose revenue. They destroy our country. They gain everything, and they wipe out our businesses, which is good for them because then they can supply us with whatever we were making. I stopped it four years ago and I will stop it very quickly again, and we'll be making the product ourselves with our labor.
We will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation into poverty. [cheers and applause]
The way they will sell their product in America without having to pay any substantial tariff for tax is to build their factory in America and build their product in America using only American help, and we have the help. [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris says that a tariff is a tax on American consumers. She's wrong. It's a tax on a foreign producer. It's a tax on a foreign country, and I proved that better than anybody because I took in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs on different states, on different countries. And out of all of that money, we had no inflation. We had no inflation.
It also gives you power over that country. If they want to have wars with somebody, we can say no. If you do have wars, we're going to raise your tariffs. Oh sir, we won't have a war. We're okay with it when we've decided not to go after somebody.
One thing a little off this, everybody said, ""Oh, we might have wars with Trump."" We had no wars with Trump. First time in 78 years, we had no wars, other than I finished some like ISIS. [cheers and applause]
100%, defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate.
What they did is Afghanistan, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. And none of the generals got fired for the incompetence that they showed. Most embarrassing moment. We would've left with dignity and strength. We would've taken our $85 billion worth of equipment. We would've taken our hostages. We lost 13 great, great people.
We had 47 people obliterated the arms, the legs, the face obliterated. What a horrible day it was. What an embarrassment. What a horrible day to have death, to have such injuries. Nobody talks about the 47 people that lost their limbs that will suffer for the rest of their lives.
As I've said many, many times before, as tariffs on foreign countries go up, taxes on American workers and families come down. According to one recent study, a small 10% tariff on foreign-made products will allow massive tax cuts for working families. Create more than 3 million American jobs, raise household incomes by 6%. Think of that. [cheers and applause]
And the 6% equates to $4,200 a year for a household, and generate almost a trillion dollars in economic growth. And it will go very quickly. It will also get rid of a large portion of our deficit.
Because we don't want countries coming in here, stealing our jobs, hurting our country, killing our workers, leaving with everything, and we as usual end up with empty factory buildings that are falling down. We end up with nothing.
We want tariffs. If somebody wants to come in and take our jobs, if somebody wants to come in and sell us their product that's made in their country, that's okay, but they've got to pay tariffs. They've got to pay a price for that. We're going to bring down your taxes at levels never seen before. We're going to pay off debt of our country, because this country owes $35 trillion. But that rapidly can come down.
And remember this, we're sitting on the largest amount of oil and gas. We have, I call it liquid gold. We have more liquid gold than Saudi Arabia. We have more liquid gold than Russia, but we don't use it. We go out and we buy from other countries at ridiculous prices. We buy now from Venezuela, we buy tar. It's not really—It's tar.
And you know where we refine it? At a factory. Only one factory in the world can do it because of the nature of it. It's tar. It's not good stuff. It's in Houston, Texas. So all of that, if you're an environmentalist, all of that's going right into the air in our country. We bring in lots of tar, loads of it. We dump it in Houston, and they refine it.
We have pure stuff. We have the best and we have the most right under our feet. It's liquid gold. And we're going to use it, and we're going to reduce our deficit. We're going to reduce our debt, and we're going to reduce your taxes. We're going to do everything right, and it's going to happen quickly too. [cheers and applause]
And as we reduce burdens on US manufacturers, our workers can make goods better and cheaper right here in our own country, and right here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
We don't need lectures on the economy from a candidate pushing communist price controls. Kamala has no idea what the hell she's doing. Her father is a Marxist professor, and I believe he taught her well. You know he's a Marxist professor. Can you imagine? Does anyone know that? I wonder if they knew that when they did an overthrow or a coup on Joe Biden. I wonder if they knew where she comes from, where she came from, what her ideology is. But you could see it a little bit by this whack job. You know, he said, we are weird. That JD and I are weird. I think we're extremely normal people, like you, exactly like you. He's weird. Did you ever see him go on the stage and go like crazy?
It's like between his movement and her laugh, there's a lot of craziness. I'd say a step further than weird. Weird is a nice word by comparison.
When I'm president, we're going to do things right. And when I was president, we imposed historic tariffs and prices, and we did it all. We did it all. Prices didn't go up. Everybody said, ""Oh, if you do that, prices."" No, the country made less money. That's what happened. Gave us tremendous political leverage over those countries too for things having nothing to do with economics. They heard China, not America. That's why the Biden administration had no choice but to leave them in place. They've left them in place. They wanted to take them off. But so much money comes in from China and other places with the tariffs that I put on, that Joe Biden, as much as he wanted to do his friends a favor, couldn't do him too much money. You couldn't justify it. There was no way to justify it.
And my next term, I will revoke China's most favorite nation trade status. It's very unfair. [cheers and applause]
And by the way, I have great respect for President Xi. I think China and the United States will get along well together. Until COVID came in, that was a step too far. But I had a great relationship with President Xi. I had a great relationship with most of the leaders.
I'll pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if China or any other countries, not just China, the European Union treats us very badly. Nobody knows that. Very badly. We have a 250 billion deficit now with the European Union. But if China, or the European Union, if any other group of countries or country makes us pay a 100% or 200% tariff or tax, we will make them pay a reciprocal tariff or tax of the exact same amount.
So it's basically, you hurt us, we hurt you. It's an eye for an eye, and it's common sense. [applause]
We will ensure that we have 100% domestic American supply chains of all essential goods.
Our supply chain has crashed. And you don't write about it now, but it still crashed. And all you have to do is say, ""Where's the package that was supposed to be here three months ago?"" People aren't getting them. It's very bad what's happened. They've destroyed our supply chain, which is something I didn't think could be done.
COVID proved that if we need it in a crisis, then we must be able to make it in America. We want to rely on ourselves. We have no choice. This is really a matter of national security.
We will bring back electronic production. We're going to bring up electronics too. Electronics, we buy everything —away. When you see the sophistication of the product I just saw at this place, electronics is peanuts by comparison, but pharmaceutical too, it's outside of this country. 95% we're reliant on various other countries, good countries, nothing wrong, but we want to do it ourselves.
They make a tremendous amount of money, and we lose our jobs. And we want to do it ourselves.
Mineral production, car production. We're going to bring back the auto industry. We can do that. We can do better than anybody in the world.
They've stolen 59% of our car making business. The union, the United Auto Workers. I think the people in that union are going to vote for me overwhelmingly, because I'm going to bring car industry back. They are destroying it. When they agreed to all electric cars, they're not going to be made in this country. We'll be making no cars in this country. And I was the one with South Korea, they got the tax put on and extended on the small trucks. And if I didn't have that tax, the most successful product made in this country is the small trucks.
If I didn't get that tax, South Korea and China would be destroying us now with additional product. We saved them. So I hope the autoworkers are listening, because they have a union boss that doesn't have a clue. He doesn't have a clue. It's sad. I wish he did. I don't have to like him. I wish he did. But he doesn't have a clue.
What he's done to the auto business in allowing this to happen, where all of those cars are going to be made in China and it's going to happen quickly. With the help of companies like this one, we will rebuild our hallowed out defense industrial base, ensuring that America is never in a situation where we don't have tanks, missiles, the raw materials to fight and win a war. We have to have those.
What would happen if we had a war? We won't, with me. But you will have World War Three, I believe, without me. But we won't have. But what would happen if we did?
And let's say it was with China, but they give us all of our steel? So we'll have to call China for steel so we can fight a war with them. How stupid are these people?
Upon taking office, I will invoke the Defense Production Act wherever it's necessary to quick—very quickly ramp up capacity of essential products. And I will stop Japan from buying United States steel. [cheers]
We have a foreign country that wants to purchase one of our greatest. If you go back 70 years, our greatest country, our greatest company by far was United States Steel Corporation. That was the big deal. And now we have Japan buying it. They shouldn't be allowed to buy it. We have to make it work. We have to make it work. You don't want to sell US Steel.
This is how we will rediscover the industrial heritage of our country. We will reclaim our manufacturing legacy. We will build up glorious American future fueled by Pennsylvania energy.
You're one of the largest in this country. You're one of the largest producers in the world. She doesn't know that. You're not going to produce. You're going to go from being one of the largest producers in terms of fracking, the energy produced into a non-factor.
Your state's going to be third world, like much of our country is being made third world by these people. They don't have a clue. But it's going to all be made with pride of the US and with Pennsylvania pride, and strengthened by strong, powerful Pennsylvania steel again.
With your vote, we will destroy inflation, bring down prices. And prices are going to come down very substantially.
Achieve incredible economic growth, make America wealthy again, and we will bring back, most importantly, we're going to bring back a thing called the American Dream. The American dream is dead. Right now the American dream is dead.
We're going to bring back the American dream. So vote for Trump on November 5th. We will be the most—[cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
CROWD: USA!, USA!, USA!, USA!
TRUMP: Thank you to Pennsylvania.
The reception coming here with the people outside waving, it was a beautiful site. The love that they have for what we're trying to do, and what we will do. I just leave you with this. Vote on November 5th or sooner.
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. We're going to turn our country around. We're going to make America great again. Thank you everybody. God bless you. [cheers and applause]
God bless Pennsylvania. God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. [cheers and applause]

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th President of the United States of America, President Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Nice place by the way. Incredible people outside. You saw the crowds, it was just incredible. [cheers]
And we really feel good about the state and the area. We're doing very well here. Just got a poll that was very good. Got a lot of good polls the last couple of days.
Thank you to the Livingston County Sheriff's Department for welcoming us in such a beautiful way. This was a beautiful welcome, and these are great people. [cheers and applause] These are great people.
And we have, in terms of law enforcement, just about every law enforcement group in the country has endorsed us, as you probably have heard. And there's a reason for that, because I believe in law enforcement, the other group doesn't.
It's always an honor to be with our brave men and women in blue and in brown, frankly, and in various colors because it's not always blue. But these are great people and you just don't do better. They're brave. They're under assault and they have a lot of difficulty with the laws of our land, and we're going to get rid of that difficulty because they shouldn't have difficulty.
Our police men and women have the backs of law-abiding citizens every single day. They take care of what they have to do in some very adverse conditions. And I'm the—when we go back to the White House, you're going to see support the likes of which you haven't seen certainly in four years.
Uh we worked very closely with the police all over the country, as you know, gave them billions of dollars of excess military equipment that was in warehouses all over the country that the Obama administration refused to give. And it was just drawing dust. Magnificent equipment, but it was just getting old, sitting in warehouses.
And I hope you guys got some of it, did you? Because I gave it, and it was billions and billions and it was nothing going to happen, whether it, except the government was paying lots of rents all over the country for big warehouses. And it was an honor to have done it and it helped a lot of the departments very, very much.
I want to thank Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy. Mike, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Where is he? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. What a great job. So respected, all of them. This group is highly respected. Mason County Sheriff Kim Cole. Kim, thank you. [applause] Van Buren County Sheriff Daniel Abbott. [applause] Thank you, Daniel. President of the Police Officer's Association of Michigan, James Tignanelli. James. [applause] Picking the wrong side. Where he is? Where are you? Come on over here, James. Let's go, get over here. [laughter] Come on. Is he allowed to stand with you guys? [laughter] I don't know. Stand up there, James. How are you? Thank you, James.
Representatives John James and John Moolenaar, these are great warrior people. [applause] Wherever you are. Where's John James? There they—oh, look at you guys. You don't get the best location because you want your constituents to be treated so well, right, huh? Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Done a great job.
Your next US senator, he's really working hard and I just saw a poll, that—doing very well, Mike Rogers. Mike. Thank you, Mike. Congressional Candidate Paul Young, who is polling beautifully, I think. Paul, good luck. Good luck, Paul. You're going to do it. And Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. [cheers] Matt, thanks. Oh, thanks Matt. Great. You look the role, Matt. Beautiful. Thank you very much, Matt.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible]
TRUMP: [laughter] You're right. That'll be next. Thank you very much.
Michigan Senate Republican leader, Aric Nesbitt. [applause] Aric. Thank you, Aric. Nice seeing you again. Doing a good job.
We're here today to talk about how we are going to stop the Kamala crime wave that is going on at levels that nobody's ever seen before. And she is, as you know, the most radical left person ever even thought of for high office, certainly for the office of president.
People don't know the real Kamala, but I do. And people that do what I do, they also know.
But she is so far left that nobody can even imagine and her real thoughts are there. You know—she's changing—they call her a flip flopper at the highest level that they've ever seen in politics because she's come out with policy for years, defund the police. You don't mind defunding, do you fellas? [looks towards police officers] Would you vote for a defunder? [booing] Would you vote—by the way, the people that you protect don't want defunders either, but she's been that until just recently, but she's always been for defunding the police. And the person that she's running with, Tim Walz, is equally far left.
This is the most far left group. Nobody's ever seen anything like it, and the press is giving them a free pass. And you're not going to have—if it was up to them, you wouldn't even have the men behind me, people behind me, representatives behind me. You wouldn't have them. They wouldn't have a job. They think it's going to just police itself. Everything's going to take care of itself.
Her father is, as you know, a Marxist professor, and he obviously did a good job, but this is where she's coming from. And you see her now with a smile, and she's gotten rid of the laugh over the last couple of days. I don't know. I haven't seen her laugh. [laughter] They've told her, ""Don't laugh, please."" [laughter]
But I'll bet inside she was laughing last night when she saw the way Joe Biden left because that was a coup. That was a coup. And I'm no fan of his at all. And it started with the debate, and from that point on, it just got worse and worse. But that was a coup. It was a vicious, violent overthrow of a president of the United States.
Since Comrade Kamala Harris took office, uh her administration's crime statistics show she's presided over a 43% increase in violent crime. These are all government numbers. 43% increase in violent crime. I'll bet the people behind me don't have anything like that. It just gets better. It doesn't get worse. Including a 58% increase in rape, 89% increase in aggravated assault and a 56% increase in robbery. The crime in America, the fact is is out of control.
I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend that everything was great, the crime was great, the border was great, there wasn't a problem at all. No inflation, no nothing.
There has been a report that the job numbers over the last period of time were fraudulent. And they—I understand that because I know how the job numbers go. And you want to be a bad person in high office you can be a bad person, but the numbers are going to be revised that the job numbers were far less at nobody's ever seen. 600,000 to a million people—jobs less. And let's see if that turns out to be true, but that's what the rumor is. It was reported by a very respected outfit, group, and we'll see what happens.
But that's a terrible insult to our economy because we were seeing numbers that were okay, not great, but now we're seeing numbers that when they're adjusted are a disaster.
But crime in America is out of control. I'm going to make it, along with the economy, inflation, strong borders and energy dominance, my top priority. I'm including crime in America. Normally, that's done locally. And uh we're going to give the local people a lot of help, like I did initially, but not that much.
We had a lot of great numbers coming out when I was president. Now, we're seeing numbers that are just absolutely horrific. The Democrats are holding their convention in Chicago in order to showcase it. And yet, as you know, on 4th of July weekend, 117 people were shot. Of the 117, 17 were killed. This is 4th of July weekend. And 40 were shot last weekend.
I don't know how many were killed, but assume a lot. And that's a war zone that's worse than Afghanistan that we read about all the time.
Speaking of Afghanistan, the worst and most embarrassing day in the history of our country, in my opinion, we left 13 dead soldiers, 47 obliterated, just obliterated the arms, the legs to face, left people behind, and we left $85 billion worth of equipment behind for the Taliban to use as it sees fit. And they're selling a lot of it because they don't need 700,000 guns and rifles. They don't need 72,000 armor plated vehicles. They're one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world right now. They're selling our equipment because they said, by the way, would've never happened with me. Abdul would never have done that, but they said we didn't have anybody shot. After my conversations with the leader of the Taliban, uh zero shot in 18 months.
We had nobody lost in 18 months. He knew that he was not going to do that. I knew that. But now you look at what's happened and it's back, we would've kept Bagram. That's the big air base, not because of Afghanistan, but because it's located one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.
So it's one hour away and we had it one of the biggest air bases in the world. We built it for billions and billions of dollars many years ago. Got the biggest runways, the biggest everything, and we just walked away from it, gave it to them, and now China's occupying it, and I thought that the scene a few days ago of the third anniversary, they call it the Defeat of America, was one of the ugliest scenes that I've seen on television in a long time. I've seen some pretty bad ones. So have you, we're witnessing some pretty bad ones.
Uh they had a parade where the parade was uh all of our equipment, a lot of our equipment, brand new beautiful armor plated trucks coming down a road and people cheering. Not that many people cheering actually, but there were people cheering, but they were making us look very bad. We have a fool, a fool as a president.
They lied last night about things that nobody's ever seen. They lied about soldiers at a grave site. They lied about Charlottesville, they lied about uh inflation. The inflation's been absolutely horrible, absolutely horrible, and everyone knows that we had virtually no inflation. They had 9%, but that wasn't including some of the things that went up more than anything else. They gave themselves a pass. But mothers will no longer be losing their children because of weak liberal policies and politicians that have given up on securing a crime free America. We want a crime free America.
We're going to stop violent crime in the United States, and it's people like this that can do the job better than anybody. They do the job justly and fairly, but there's nobody like these people. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
There's nobody like them, so they can do it. They have to be given back their rights and their dignity. They have to be allowed to do their job.
We're going to be uh guaranteeing immunities, and I'm not looking necessarily uh just here, but we have police in various areas that are pretty rough areas. If they do their job, if they're diligent in doing their job, they go after the police officer rather than the criminal. They lose their house, they lose their pension, they lose their family, they lose everything. They lose everything. Then we're going to make sure that doesn't happen.
Over the past four years, the Marxist left has waged a vicious war on law enforcement in our country.
They've taken away the dignity and the spirit and the life of some of these police officers, and that's why you see it.
The crime is so out of control in our country. I mean, you have cities, I will say this, the top 25 almost all are run by Democrats and they have very similar policies. It's just insane. But you can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be, and you've seen it and I've seen it, and it's time for a change.
We have to bring back our cities. We have these cities that are great cities where people are afraid to live in America. They're fleeing the cities of our country. What we would consider, what we did consider, you know interestingly like New York when I left for Washington, New York was we had a very bad Mayor de Blasio, but he wasn't there that long and he couldn't ruin what took place.
But uh we had a city that was so wonderful and so thriving, and just in a few short years that changed, New York state is doing terribly. I heard the governor last night speaking so viciously and violently about me, but she doesn't speak about what they've done to destroy the state.
The law enforcement has been decimated.
The judges, what's gone on with the judges in New York? Nobody—there's no justice. We're not getting justice in New York. And yet she speaks so bravely about things that she shouldn't be speaking about.
But you look at radical liberal Kamala Harris, she's been the ringleader for this anti-crime and the anti-police crusade. It's a real anti-police crusade.
They uh just have it out for the police. Nobody knows why. I don't understand why from a common sense. I like to say the Republican Party is now the party of common sense. Conservative, yeah, I guess conservative. It doesn't matter. It's the party of common sense.
We want to have borders. We want have strong police protection. We want a military that can protect us. We want great school, school choice ideally. We want have a good life. We want to be safe.
But let's review Kamala's pro crime, anti-police record. She repeatedly endorsed defunding the police, which I said, and it said a level, and it never goes away. When you're a defunder or when you are even a politician, your first thought usually is the thought that you go with. If she ever had a chance, she would do whatever she could to defund the police.
Cause, that's where her spirit is. That's where her heart is, and we can't have a president like that. She sponsored a bill to strip police officers of legal protection leaving you at the mercy of the lawless Marxist prosecutors who want to lock up police officers for sport.
They lock them up in many cases long before they lock up the criminal and they go after them too violently. They don't go after the criminals. Murderers are released two hours after the murder.
She wants to bankrupt the police unions. She wants to destroy policemen in general, and they ruin your lives, your jobs, and they ruin everything you've lived for, everything you've felt that you want to make great. You want to make our country great.
When I'm President of the United States, again, we will never even think about or mention the words defund the police. We'll never think about that again. It's got to be put away. [cheers and applause] It's a bad situation. It's a bad concept.
The concept is so chilling and so horrible to think that what we should be thinking about is the opposite of defunding, refunding you called. We'll refund, but we want to help the police.
They have a very dangerous job lately. I see if somebody—I was with a great family a few months ago, opens the door to a car and gets shot and they have all sorts of protection for the people in the car. You can't have your gun even close to being drawn. You don't know what's happening. A lot of the windows are dark, so you don't know who's in there, but the door opens and just gets shot.
Great police officer and many, many cases. A dangerous—it's a dangerous business and we have to give them protection and we have to give them love and respect, and that's what we're going to do.
We were doing it and they're not doing it now.
We'll give our law enforcement heroes the kind of protection and the resources that they so dearly deserve, and I will crack down on local Marxist DAs who refuse to enforce the law. They refuse to put murderers in jail, and you see it all over as the district attorney of San Francisco.
Kamala Harris was one of the worst and one of the first Marxist prosecutors in America. She said that uh, and some people said she was the godmother of both sanctuary cities because this was a while ago. This was when it all started, and that horrible shoplifting epidemic.
She shielded illegal alien crack dealers from deportation. She fought like hell to have crack dealers not deported. She came up with a concept of $950 and below. You don't even get prosecuted. $950, so guys are walking into stores with calculators to figure out, do you know that they have calculators?
They adding it up. They want to make sure they're under 950, but it didn't matter because they didn't prosecute the ones that went over either.
She ignored the pleas of victims, families members and refused to seek the death penalty against, as an example, an illegal alien, MS 13 gang member, these are the worst gangs in the world who murdered an innocent man and his two sons were absolutely no reason. They said, ""Why did you do it?"" He said, ""I felt like it. I felt like it.""
So uh when Kamala, until recently was called a Marxist prosecutor, she didn't even disclaim the title. She sort of liked it. As the California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as a nonviolent crime. All of them were redefined by her as nonviolent.
Kamala Harris supports abolishing cash bail nationwide.
Cash bail has been a disaster. When you abolish the no cash, no cash, don't worry about cash, you murdered somebody, don't worry about it. That was really the beginning of problems for New York. Big problems for New York, but elsewhere also.
But it means releasing violent criminals immediately after arrest. No money involved. Don't worry about it. Go home. Enjoy yourself. Many of them disappear. You never find them again. Many of them immediately start killing again. It's just a crazy situation.
She supports ending jail sentences for parole violators. She considers a parole violation not to be serious. When the violent mobs of looters and anarchists tried to burn down Minneapolis in 2020. Kamala Harris raised money, bailed to bail out the arsonists and the riders and the killers. People were killed. Many people were killed. Compare that to J6. Nobody was killed. Nobody was killed. There weren't fires set.
They burned down the city. They were burning down Minneapolis, and she went out and not only did she work a little bit with them, she worked a lot with them. She worked to get them out and to set them free.
One of the criminals Kamala helped bail out of jail was Shawn Michael Tillman, one of the worst, a dangerous repeat offender. Had a horrible record of violence. With Kamala's help, she was set free. He was set free. Soon, went on to murder a man on a train platform for no reason whatsoever in St. Paul, shooting him six times in the head and in the torso. No reason whatsoever. What's the reason? No reason, just felt like it.
Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death. If she's allowed to be the President of the United States you'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before.
I will deliver law, order, safety and peace, and I will protect those who protect us. These people protect us. These are unbelievable people. They protect us. We have to protect them. We have to give them hope because so many are leaving the forces. I can't speak for this group because I'd love to work for them.
I would be joining them in two minutes. It looks like a nice job there. So they look because they've handled themselves and crime and everything else in a stern way, and it's probably uh a lot easier to do. Maybe we should switch them around to different territories of your state, of our nation and let some other guys take—would you like that fellers, I have a feeling you don't want that? I don't want to embarrass you. [laughter] I don't want to say any particular names of locations, but I can think of a big one in the state.
I'd love to have them working there during the election, I can tell you, but no, but they have it all very much under control, and that's the way it should be.
So we're going to make a record investment in hiring, retention, and training of police officers. We're losing tremendous numbers of police officers. These are men and women that want to be police officers and they're just leaving. We're going to get you reinforcements and we're not going to be doing the negative.
Let's pay them much less or let's defund entirely. Let's pay them. There's a movement on now. We won't defund, but we'll pay them much less money. No. No. I've never realized how dangerous a job it was.
I have some papers here where if you watch the event last night—this is by the way, [holds up chart titled Illegal Immigration into the U.S.] my all time favorite chart, which is because if you've watched last night, you wouldn't know that border was so bad. This was right here, this arrow on the bottom, lowest ever. This is made by border patrol. That's the lowest ever we had for illegal aliens coming into our country. And that was the week I left office. That's the lowest ever.
Now, this chart is very dear to my heart for another reason. This was the chart. I said, ""Let me see. Let me see it.""
But it says a lot, and we had a couple of instances last night where things were mentioned so I got it. Did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden? They said it rose under Trump. And they go, ""No, the opposite is true."" Take a look at this here. [holds up report] It said, ""Is it true, did crime rise under Trump and fall under Biden?"" ""No, the opposite is true."" This was a study group that went out and doesn't care. They do the numbers.
And there was another one that a historical comparison of the collapse of law enforcement in U.S. cities. The drop in arrest rates over the last few years is without precedent, lowest arrest rates we've ever seen. They don't arrest people anymore. And they shouldn't arrest people for saying the election was rigged, but they liked that.
They go after guys like me, but they don't go after people that kill people. It's a shame what's happened in our country. But we're going to turn it around. We're going to win big and we're going to turn it around. We're going to turn it around fast. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you.
We'll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks and bloodthirsty cartels, and we will stop the Fentanyl, and we'll make sure that Kamala Harris has, and all of the people that she's allowed to come across the border—don't forget she was the border czar, whether she wants to hear it or not.
CROWD MEMBER: Still is.
TRUMP: She still is. Thank you. In fact, you could do it right now. They like to talk, it's all nonsense, that Donald Trump stopped a bill. I was opposed to it. So was everyone else. It was the weakest bill. Under that bill, millions of people would've been allowed to come in. This was a weak bill. But you didn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I said, ""Close the border."" And that's how we got to those numbers, the lowest ever recorded. I said, ""Close the border."" I didn't have a bill. I didn't need a bill. She doesn't need a bill.
Biden doesn't know where he is, so where is he? Whatever happened to him? He got out. He got out. He's now sunbathing. He's in a beach someplace.
But all he would have to do as president or her is say, close up the border and it's closed. But they don't want to close the border because when they first took over, I had built hundreds of miles of wall and I had 200 miles of wall in addition to what I said I was going to do because certain areas needed it. As we closed areas, other areas became um very, very strong in terms of people wanting to come through. So I bought 200 additional miles. It would've taken about three weeks to erect it.
We're all set to erect it, then we had a terrible election take place, terrible election. And everybody here knows that.
And I realized that they don't want to do it. And they actually sold that. And that was designed to the highest specifications of when you look at the steel, it's steel, it's concrete, 5,000 pound concrete inside and then rebar. And it also has a lot of technology wires and things in it for high technology. It was designed to the highest specs of the border patrol.
I wanted actually concrete plank. I would've done a beautiful job with precast like you have in parking garages, long span. It's called long span precast. But they had to be able to see through. I understand that. They needed certain things that you can't do with concrete plank.
So we did that, and very expensive to do because you needed all sorts—in other words, they wanted the steel, they wanted the concrete. It's all different methods of very hard to cut it, very hard to do it when you have different substances. And then very powerful rebar inside.
And what happened is, as soon as they came in, they sold it for 5 cents on the dollar. They sold this stuff. Somebody made a lot of money because that steel is very valuable. But they sold all of that hundreds of miles of stuff. You saw it stacked up for a long period of time where they stacked it up in an area because Texas wanted to use it and finish the job.
We built hundreds of miles. But Texas wanted it. They would've paid for it. They refused to sell it to Texas. They refused to sell it to Arizona. And they refused to sell it to anybody. They sold it to the junkyards, I guess, and 5 cents on the dollar.
On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the invasion. We had the border sealed. I had Mexico, I had thousands of soldiers from Mexico, free of charge. I said to the president, ""You must give us soldiers because they're coming through. The caravans are coming through your country."" ""No, no, no, I cannot do that."" I said, ""Yes, you'll do that. If you don't do that, I'm going to put tariffs on your cars."" And he said, ""I will do that, sir."" [laughter] And he did it. He did it very quickly.
And it really, you guys heard all about it, made a great difference. We had thousands of Mexican soldiers guarding our borders that, look, they're coming through your country. You have to guard your southern border, which is their border on the other side. And all of a sudden they started and we had it. We had remain in Mexico. It's called Remain in Mexico policy, which we never had. And they stayed in Tijuana, different places, hundreds of thousands of people that didn't come into our country until they were checked. And then if they were good, we let them in. And if they weren't, we wouldn't let them in.
And we worked well with Mexico, actually. But now Mexico has really taken advantage of our country. They want 200—they want billions of dollars just to talk. They wouldn't say that with me. They wanted, I think $2 billion to talk, right? ""We will talk. We want $2 billion before we even start."" That wouldn't happen with me. I would say, ""Oh really? Is that right? That's the end of trade with Mexico."" And they would say, ""Sir, we will give you two billion. How about that?""
So I'll send Kamala's illegal aliens back home where they belong. We have a problem because when I came in, they wouldn't accept MS-13 gang members. I told the generals we're going to get the gang members out. ICE and border patrol, the job these people do. But ICE would go into the country, get the MS-13 gang members out, the meanest, the most vicious.
They kill people with knives. They killed two young students walking to school, two beautiful, young sixteen-year-old girls walking to school. They killed them up and chopped them up into pieces with knives. Dead.
And ICE goes in and they go into those packs of rough, rough people and ICE is rougher than they are. These are incredible, brave patriots.
A lot of people wouldn't want that job.
You see fists and feet, you see everything flying. And then two minutes later, they stand up and they grab them and they throw them into what they used to call a paddy wagon. They put them into planes, say, ""Take them out."" The countries wouldn't take them back under President Obama.
And I said, ""Really? They're not going to take them back? Well, if they're not going to take them back, I'm going to stop paying them."" I said, ""How much money do we pay these countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and others?"" I said, ""How much money do we pay?"" $750 million. I said, ""Good. Inform them we're not paying them anymore.""
And the following morning, I got calls from all of these countries. ""Sir, sir, there must be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. [cheers and applause] We would love to have MS-13. We would love to have MS-13 back in our country. It would be a great honor to have them back.""
And before we get too far, we're almost finished, but before we get too far, I want to tell you that we have criminals from all over the world pouring into our country right now. [looks towards police] Your job will never be obsolete. It will never be obsolete, unfortunately. It'd be nice if we could have peace, but we're not going to have peace. And this is something we're going to have to live with for a long time.
She has allowed millions of people, open border, to flow into our country totally unchecked, totally unvetted. And they come from jails and prisons, slightly different. They come from mental institutions, all mental institutions all over the world.
This isn't just in South America. People think it's South America. It's from Africa, Asia, the Middle East. A lot of people coming from the Congo in Africa, the Congo, rough, rough, rough. And they're uh prisoners. They're prisoners. And we say, ""Where do you come from?"" ""Africa."" ""Where in Africa?"" ""Prison."" ""What did you do?"" ""We don't want to say."" They turn out to be murderers.
These are rough people. And we're allowing them into our country from all over the world. From South America, yes, but from all over the world.
They come from insane asylums. And many are terrorists. So we have prisoners, mental patients, mental institution patients, terrorists pouring into our country totally unchecked, unvetted.
We have some of the worst terrorists in the world. We know where they are approximately, but we don't know too much. But we know they're the worst. We have the worst terrorists in the world pouring into our country. And she's the president and wants to be the President of the United States.
She's vice president. She could do it. She's in charge of the border. She could have closed up the border. She should have closed it up.
They could have told Mexico, ""If you don't do it, we're not going to do something."" We're not going to have trade. We're not going to deal with you. We're not going to let you sell your cars into the United States at these ridiculous, where they took 32% of our car industry over many years. They took it out of Detroit. They took it out of different places. But they took it and they took it big from this state, from South Carolina, from a lot of different places. They took 32%. And I think now the number is bigger.
You know, I don't know if you know that they're building some of the biggest car plants in the world right now in Mexico. Wouldn't have happened with me. Right now in Mexico. And China's the one building them, and they think they're going to build, make these cars and then release them into the United States without tax. It's not going to happen. We'll put a hundred percent to a 200% tariff. We're not going to let it happen, because all of our jobs from your state will be gone.
And I watched this union head, he's an incompetent guy. He's approving for what he did for what he's allowed every job, every autoworker here will be out of a job within three years if I'm not elected, every autoworker in the state. They're all going to be made in China. They're going to an all-electric policy. Well, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any country in the world, but we don't have for what you need for an electric car.
But China does, and its territories do and we're not going to let it happen. But they're building some of the biggest plants.
And I have a friend who builds plants. He said, ""Some of the biggest in the world,"" I think he's doing them, ""are being built in Mexico."" And they're going to sell cars, produce them, and sell them in this country with no taxes. It's not going to happen. I told him, I said, ""You better hope I don't win.""
Always dangerous to say these things. Maybe that's why I get shot at and other people don't, right, John James? [laughter] That's probably why I get shot at. Other people, they will protect other people because they can't believe they got so lucky. But I have to do what I have to do. I have to do the right thing.
The Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed hordes of illegal alien criminals to literally stampede into our country. We're going to end that on day one. We're going to close our border. We're going to get all of the bad ones out, and we're going to get them out fast. In Shelby Township, Michigan, earlier this year, thirty-two-year-old, previously deported illegal alien, monster, was arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a young girl under the age of 13. Local law enforcement described the crimes as absolutely horrific and says he had many other victims, including death is involved. Death. Young girls.
In St. Joseph County, Michigan, an illegal alien was recently charged with breaking into a home and sexually assaulting two very little girls, very badly assaulting. In Mississippi, just days ago, an illegal alien child predator was charged with raping a ten-year-old boy. And there were other cases where they were raping ten-year-old boys and girls. And in many cases, they were dead. They were killed.
Last week, in Coney Island, two Kamala migrants were arrested for the rape of a forty-six-year-old woman, woman who was loved by so many people, throwing her to the ground and raping her over and over again, and then working her over with a knife to her throat. One of them had previously been arrested for raping another woman, but he was shielded from deportation by the New York City sanctuary laws, which Kamala strongly supports. She wants it very much. The woman said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. She thought she was dead. She survived, but she thought she was dead. She said he didn't want to rape me, he wanted to kill me. This is what we're allowing into our country.
And then you hear, ""Oh no, the people coming in, they're much less violent than the people"" That's not right. They're much more violent and that they make a hat. Sheriff, they make a hat, and I don't want to brag, but it says Trump was right about everything. And if you look, whether it's the border, this, I've been right about everything. Unfortunately. I wish I wasn't. [applause]
So when I return to the White House, we will stop the plunder, rape, slaughter, and destruction of our American suburbs, our cities and towns.
And I think that women living in the suburbs, I keep hearing about the suburban woman doesn't like Trump. Well, I think it's a fake poll because why wouldn't they like me? I keep the suburbs safe. I stopped low-income towers from rising right alongside of their house, and I'm keeping the illegal aliens away from the suburbs. I think that they like me a lot. I think it's a lot of fake polls.
We've seen a lot of fake polls over the years. I was not supposed to win anything, and we won the big one. We won it and did a lot better the second time than I did the first. But women want to have safety. They want to have a strong military. They want to have a strong police force. They want to be in their house and they want to be safe. [cheers and applause] They don't want to have people pouring into their doors and you can't do anything about it.
So I think that's number one thing. I hope they like my personality. I have a nice personality. But to me it wouldn't be very important, the personality.
They want to be safe and they want people like this happy, and they want people like this taken care of properly because those are the people that keep them safe.
So we'll shut down all deadly sanctuary cities throughout the country because all they do is they shield criminals. They basically shield criminals from prosecution.
I will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement. We're going to put a lot of immigration enforcement. We're going to close down the border day one.
And we are going to—just so you understand, I am not a radical at all. I'm just a common sense person that was successful in what I did because of the same thing. We are going to let people, and we want people, to come into our country. A lot of people, we need them. We need them for jobs. We need them for everything.
We want people to come in, but they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. And we can let a lot of them come in, but John, we want them to come into our country legally. [applause] We don't want to let people come in who murdered 19 people and then you hire that person in a plant and all of a sudden you notice that people are being killed all over town. We want them to come in legally.
On day one, we'll begin the largest domestic deportation operation in the history of our country, bigger than Dwight Eisenhower. Dwight Eisenhower was very—he was sort of a moderate person, but he hated when people poured into our country and he was very strong on deportation. We will remove all criminal aliens immediately. All of the criminals. We start with that. We're going to get them out of here fast. Nothing good is going to happen with thousands of terrorists being in our country.
We had one month where border patrol was actually um does a chart, and I don't believe this. I love it in a certain way, but I don't. They said in 2019, zero terrorists came in. Now, I don't believe that, but it's an awfully good statistic. But it was very few that came in. We were very tough on that. We had everybody check so carefully and they added, actually, in 2019, they had zero.
Now, you have thousands of terrorists coming into our country. Thousands of terrorists. These are the people that blew up the World Trade Center. Bad things will happen.
And if I'm elected, we're going to get them the hell out of here and we're going to get them out of here fast. Very fast. And I told you that other countries who really, they put their people into groups, they send them up here, and by the thousands.
The caravans, I think it was the name that I came up with, I don't know, maybe somebody will say ""he's lying about that, somebody else used the term 14 days earlier."" But we came up because it just seemed like an appropriate term. It's a caravan of thousands of people. We have one caravan coming up right now, thousands of people that go right into the country. But I call these—they wouldn't take the MS-13 people back or other criminals back. And the generals said, ""we are just not able to do it, sir, because they won't take them back.""
They'd put planes on the runways so that you couldn't land the plane. They'd block up the bus lanes so you couldn't bring the buses and you couldn't get them back.
And when I told them that they wouldn't get any more money, I said, ""let them know they're delinquent, they broken the deal. We're not going to get any more money."" We paid them, for years, hundreds of millions of dollars. The next morning, all three countries called me, like clockwork, separately. ""Sir, is there a misunderstanding? I understand that perhaps you would like to talk to us."" I said, ""yeah, you're sending people into"" And they're sending them, by the way. They don't want them. They're sending them.
All of the countries are sending them, and now they're coming in because of her, because she's so pathetic and weak at the border. The worst job. The worst border czar in history. [applause] I can tell you that. Whether she's a czar or just in charge of the border, it doesn't matter. But they're sending them in levels that we've never seen before and they're destroying our country.
But they all said, all three, it was almost like identical conversations, it was, ""sir, is there anything we can do to make up for this misunderstanding?"" I said, ""yep, you take your MS-13, and you take your gang members and you take your criminals and your drug dealers. We're sending them back and we're sending them back today.""
And we sent thousands and thousands of people back. This has stopped for years. Under Bush, it stopped and under Obama it stopped. But this had been taking place for years, and I only found out about it, I said, ""that's good. Get them out.""
I don't want to put them in our jails because we put them in our jails, what are we going to do? Keep them for 50 years, 60 years? And the expense. The really bad ones, we did do that, though, however, because we don't want them coming back.
But all of them said, ""sir, we would be delighted to take MS-13 back. This would be a great honor. They're such lovely people."" And we took them out by the thousands. We took MS-13. ICE took MS-13 out of our country by the thousands and thousands and they received them, and that's the way. It's just another little story, but it's a story that's very important because I can't see a guy like Biden making that call.
Do you think Biden thinks at night, ""gee, how are we going to get MS-13 out?"" He doesn't know he's alive. He didn't know he's alive. And this one is just a Marxist. She's a Marxist, Communist person, and we're not ready for a Communist president, okay? We're not ready for it. We're going to destroy our country.
Under my leadership, no community will be surrendered to violent criminals. No citizen will be abandoned to migrant crime.
We have a new form of crime. It's called migrant crime, and it's probably more vicious than the crime that we already have, which is pretty vicious. These people are vicious. And please don't let anyone convince you that our criminals, and we have more crime. They are sending massive number of criminals.
And you've heard me say this before, Venezuela crime is down 72%. 72. Because they've taken their criminals out of Caracas, they've taken their criminals out of all of their cities, all of their areas, all over the country, and they're sending them to us. And I'm amazed that they're not doing it quicker, to be honest with you. It's happening fast. They're also emptying out the jails.
And this is true all over the world. They're emptying out their prisons and they're taking their criminals off the streets. They're taking their drug dealers and their crime rates are down at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
And everyone says, ""oh, so-and-so's doing a great job running such-and-such a country."" No, they're not. They're just very intelligent. I would do it, if I were them. I would do it much faster. I can't believe they still have some left. But their jails are getting to be very empty. And what they're doing is they're literally dropping them in. They're busing them in and they're bringing them in and they're saying, ""don't ever come back. If you come back, you get the death penalty,"" or ""if you come back, you get killed. Don't ever come back.""
And you see the crime statistics are unbelievable. If you look at the jails, the jails are—they've never been so low in the world. I'm talking all over the world because they're sending their criminals to the United States of America and they're saying, ""don't ever come back.""
And their jails are being emptied and their criminals are being taken off the streets and their crime rates are plummeting. But that's what we want for our country, so we're sending those people back and these are the people that can do it. [applause]
We're going to have a reformed Department of Justice. We'll, once again, be a friend and partner to our great local police and police officers, general, and we'll be working with victims of crime very closely, but we'll not be working with the criminals that commit the crime. We're going to change it around.
Right now, the criminal has a lot more respect within our Department of Justice than the victims. We're going to be working with the victims. We're going to get the gangsters, the drug dealers, the dangerous offenders behind bars, and we're going to get them ideally out of our country, ideally, except in extreme cases. We have some extreme cases where they've murdered many people. And in that case, we want to make sure they're away.
But the amount of crime that we have is unbelievable and the lack of crime that these other places. It just makes so much sense, doesn't it? That's all common sense too. They're taking their criminals and they're bringing them to the United States and they look so great, and cities like Caracas, which was a very dangerous place to be, these are cities that have opened up, they have new life. But our country is suffering.
And you know, they just got here over the last two years, mostly over the last couple of years, during this administration, during our great border czar who wants to be our president. They'll be laughing.
Watch President Xi, will be laughing. Putin will be laughing. They'll all be laughing.
By the way, the war with Russia would've never started with Ukraine, would've never started if I was President. October 7th would've never happened. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. This is a very dangerous time that we're in. It's dangerous in terms of crime and all, but it's very dangerous in terms of a possible World War III.
We're very close to World War III and people don't realize it. We're closer than we've ever been. I think ever since World War II. But this would be the war of wars because of weaponry. This isn't, as I say, two army tanks going back and forth shooting at each other. The level of power, the level of weaponry that there is in the world today is so bad. It's so dangerous. It's so bad. And you need the right person to be President.
We had no war when I was President, except that I totally defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. Everyone said it would take five years. It took me like about four weeks because we have a great military.
We have great generals. Not the ones you see on television, not the ones that did the Afghanistan botchery, but we have great military people. I know them, and they're never going woke. You keep hearing our militaries going woke. The top people would like to see it, but it's never going to—these not people, just like these people will never be—[turns to police officers behind him] Do you promise you'll never be woke? [laughter] I don't see a lot of wokeness. There's not a lot of wokeness. [applause]
I don't think so. But we're going to stand up for law-abiding citizens of America. We're going to be really, I think, an inspiration to the world. But we have to start by remedying a situation that was caused by somebody that right now is running for President of the United States.
She would be a disaster as President. I love our country. I didn't need this. I didn't have to do this. I didn't need to get indicted by any time I fly over a state, they indict you. I got indicted more than the great Alphonse Capone, right? For nothing. My father's looking down, my mother's looking down. He was such a good boy. I don't know what happened.
But I didn't need this. I had a beautiful life. But to me, I wouldn't change it for the world because we're going to take this country, we're going to make it safe again, and we're going to make America great again. And I want to thank everybody for being here, and God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you.

    ANNOUNCER: Please welcome Kid Rock [cheers and applause]
KID ROCK: Wow, Thank you. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome uh welcome to Detroit Rock City, as we say. [cheers and applause]
And uh no matter what your background is, what your politics are, any of that. Before we get going here, those of you serving, who have served, I'm sure I speak forever when I say thank you for your service. [cheers and applause]
Um I'd just like to talk for two seconds about my service and there's a point to this. So if it sounds like a little toot of my own horn or a pat on my back, there's a point to this. Uh probably some of the most rewarding, the most rewarding things I've done in my life and career have been being able to perform for our troops all over the world. From Kosovo, Germany, Afghanistan, Iraq, UAE, Turkey, Italy, England, all across the U.S. But how did that start? [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
But I want to tell you a little story of how that started. Many moons ago, some of you younger ones maybe weren't even walking yet. There was a horrible attack, a terrorist attack in Yemen on one of our ships called the USS Cole, where 17 sailors lost their lives. And when they were getting towed out of that harbor, you can imagine their brothers and sisters, people serving with them were pretty upset, pretty pissed off, but the upper brass said they could play patriotic music while they're getting pulled out of there. And one of those wise guys put on a little song by myself called American Badass, and they were pretty upset. I got a few pictures with these guys after losing 17 of their brothers and sisters. They got F Yemen across their chests and a couple middle fingers in the air. And it gave me chills when I found out about it.
But more importantly, my mother, who's with me today, just celebrated her 80th birthday. [applause] It was her, who I might note that her father, my grandfather and my uncle and her brother served in World War II and Vietnam, suggested she said, ""You know, should do something to help out with them."" And this was kind of before all the crazy wars and everything in the Middle East broke out. And I said, ""You know what? You're right."" And I was raised to be very patriotic and love my country. And, and so it just happened we were playing in Virginia where we have a big presence in our military and the Navy and I was able to play a show there and donate that money to the families of those 17 sailors that lost their lives.
And that was because one reason, because of my mom, Susan Ritchie. So how about an applause for mama Rock who's here tonight? [cheers and applause]
She's a little shy. She's a little shy. Probably back there cutting it up with the president. [laughter] I also apologize, I did not get the dress memo today clearly. But enough of me rambling on here. There she is. Hi mom. Love you.
Now, enough of me rambling on. Once again, welcome to our beautiful city, Detroit. I'm so proud to be from in and around here. It's great to be back, especially with so many of you great patriots.
So let's bring on the man now, right? Probably want to hear somebody else speak. [cheers] Well, how about we give a big old Detroit welcome, a huge military salute and welcome to our 45th and soon to be 47th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.
[music: Lee Greenwood, God Bless the USA.]
TRUMP: Thank you.
Having Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as Bob, I call him Bob, but he's a great guy. I'll tell you that, he's a great guy and a talented one, and it's an honor to be with all of you incredible patriots, really an honor, a great one.
And I'm thrilled to be here in Detroit with the incredible men and women of our National Guard. Very special people.
I've had no greater honor in life than to serve as your Commander in Chief, and you are always ready and always there for us and for the President of the United States, you are always there for me, I will tell you and I'm always going to be there for you. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
And we're doing very well as you probably see. And hopefully I can say when I'm back in the White House, I'll get you the support, funding, training, and equipment you need, and I will get you the pay raises that you've really deserved for a long time. [cheers and applause] We'll get it taken care of. For a long time.
I want to thank the Chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States, Major General Janson D. Boyles, and also Vice Chair Major General Jimmie Cole. [applause] Thank you both. Thank you very much.
I also want to thank members of Congress, very special warriors and patriots, they're very strong people. They love our country. Lisa McClain. Where's Lisa? She's so incredible.[applause] Lisa, thank you. Thank you, Lisa. John James. [applause] John, thank you. John James is a star and doing really well. Thanks John. Tim Walberg and Michael Waltz. Thank you very much Michael and Tim. And again, I want to thank Kid Rock for being here. He's really been a great friend of mine for a long time.
Each and every one of the guard members here today inherits the proud spirit of the citizen soldier running all the way back to the Minutemen who stood against tyranny at Concord Bridge. Has everybody heard of Concord Bridge? Yes, I think so. You carry forward the legacy of Old Hickory division that earned more medals of honor than any division in the army in World War I and the North Dakota Guardsmen who've walked through hellfire at Guadalcanal. [applause]
And it was the Air National Guard that thundered into the skies to defend us on 9/11. We all remember that all too well. And when our country is hit by fire, flood, or vicious storm, America turns to the National Guard because we know we can always count on you. We always can count on you. I've counted on you a lot.
The National Guard is America's first and last line of defense, and you do not get the credit you deserve. But actually, you do because down deep everybody knows it. You get a lot of credit in your own way, a little bit different. But we really respect and appreciate the job you do. Thank you to every Guardsman for your selfless service.
I want to thank also our amazing National Guard families because, especially the spouses and the children—[cheers and applause], I mean, let's face it, without which you would never be the same. You'd never be the same. But they sacrifice so much.
All of us in this room have something very special in common. We're all proud, hard-working citizens who have stepped forward to defend American freedom. And we continue to do that. And it's why I'm here today because America's future is under threat like never before right at this moment in my opinion, our country is at the most dangerous level we've ever been.
And I hate to say this, but we have a president who went on vacation a week ago and now he came back and he went on vacation again. And we have people that are fighting all over the place and threatening our country as we speak. I don't think we've ever been closer to World War III than we are right now. It's a terrible thing.
Our country is being destroyed by a radical political class that sends our guardsmen and women to defend the borders of distant foreign nations while they surrender our own borders to an invasion right here at home, the likes of which we've never seen before.
You miss birthdays and holidays deploying overseas in the global war on terror. Only Kamala Harris is letting terrorists come into our country at record numbers and letting Jihadists pour into our homeland by the thousands and thousands and thousands. Can't do that.
And while you have risked your lives to defend our rights and liberties and our borders, our opponents have waged war on those liberties from the White House, attacking free speech, censoring dissidents, and trying to put their political opposition in jail. Never happened before.
I'm in this fight to defeat the corrupt political class in Washington that's hurting you very badly, whether we know it or not, and to reclaim America's future as a free and sovereign nation ruled by the American people.
When I'm back in the White House, we will expel the warmongers, the profiteers, and take over our government and we will restore world peace and it will be again, peace through strength. [cheers and applause]
On day one, I will seal the border and I will stop the invasion of millions of people into our country. [applause]
We will find and remove the terrorists and jihadists who have infiltrated our soil. And under my leadership, we'll bring back the values that you enlisted your lives to defend: sovereignty, liberty, free speech, and fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law.
We are not just going to make America great again. We're going to make American democracy great again. We're going to bring it back.
My opponent, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are promising the exact opposite. They want endless war, open borders, voting rights, and free healthcare for illegal aliens, Soviet-style price control, censorship, unlimited migration from terrorist hotspots and unchecked power for the deep state. This fight is no longer between Democrats and Republicans. This is a fight between communism and freedom. It's very serious fight.
That's why millions of traditional Democrats, including FDR Democrats, JFK Democrats, independents, and old-fashioned liberals are joining our movement. Our poll numbers are great. We're uniting forces to end the endless foreign wars, stop the censorship, end weaponization of our government, defend our borders, rebuild our middle class, protect the health of our children and, above all, to restore our republic and vanquish the corruption that's all over Washington D.C. right now.
Three days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. We're very proud. [applause] Thank you. We're very proud to welcome Bobby to our cause. He's really a terrific guy. He's a terrific person and he's going to do a lot of great things. I have no doubt about it. He's got some very good ideas. Some ideas that people weren't listening to, it's turned out to be right.
And today I'm honored to officially welcome another true American patriot, a 17-year veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, a four-term Democrat congresswoman. Very, very popular. The former vice chair of the National Democratic Party and a 2020 Democrat candidate for the United States presidency. She was a very good candidate. Every time she ran, she was good. She did well. She decided to leave. She couldn't take it anymore. But she is very special. And I didn't know this, but she was a lieutenant colonel. That's not bad, lieutenant colonel. [laughter] Not bad. I didn't know that. I just found out. I said, ""Put it down. You gotta put that down. That's bigger—that's better than all the other stuff I read."" But no, she's a special person. She's got great common sense, great spirit. She loves our country and she loves the people in this room. Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, please. [cheers and applause]
TULSI GABBARD: Thank you very much.
TRUMP: Have a good time.
GABBARD: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Aloha.
CROWD: Aloha
GABBARD: I know we got Hawaii in the house here. [cheers] There we go. It is a privilege to be here with all of you, my brothers and sisters in uniform, especially on this day of all days. I had the privilege of joining President Trump this morning at Arlington Cemetery, where he joined two Gold Star families and loved ones of Staff Sergeant Hoover and Sergeant Gee, both of whom were two of the 13 killed in the Abbey Gate attack three years ago today in Kabul.
And I can tell you, as we were there, as he laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joining these Marines loved ones, I felt the sorrow that he shared with them in their loss. I felt and saw his sincere appreciation for these servicemen and women who paid the ultimate price and their loved ones who continue to grieve to this day.
This is personal for me as I know it is for so many of you here. This is real. It's not just words. I first deployed to Iraq in 2005 with the Hawaii Army National Guard as a member of Charlie Med. [applause] As those of you who were deployed during that time know, it was at the height of the war, and sadly, we took many casualties. And every day we were confronted with that high human cost of war and that sadness as we boarded the plane when we left, that we were leaving some of our brothers and sisters behind only to lose others when we got home to suicide.
So I mean what I say when I share with you that I know that President Trump understands the grave responsibility that a president and Commander in Chief bears for every single one of our lives. Whether you're a soldier, you're an airman, a Marine, sailor, or a Coastie, he keeps us in his heart in the decisions that he makes.
We saw this through his first term in the presidency when he not only didn't start any new wars, he took action to de-escalate and prevent wars. He exercised the courage that we expect from our Commander in Chief in exhausting all measures of diplomacy, having the courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies, and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort.
The truth is, as we head towards our decision as a country in November. The same cannot be said about Kamala Harris. In fact, the opposite is true and we are living through this reality today as this administration has us facing multiple wars on multiple fronts and regions around the world and closer to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before.
This is one of the main reasons why I'm committed to doing all that I can to send President Trump back to the White House, where he can once again serve us as our Commander-in-Chief. [cheers and applause]
Because I am confident that his first task will be to do the work, to walk us back from the brink of war. We cannot be prosperous unless we are at peace and we can't live free as long as we have a government that is retaliating against its political opponents and undermining our civil liberties, weaponizing our very institutions against those they deem as a threat.
Kamala Harris has done this over the last three and a half years. She won't hesitate to continue that if she is elected as president.
President Trump has been their first and foremost target in this because they don't want us as voters to even have the option to vote for him.
I've been their most recent target. Added to a secret domestic terror watch list after exposing the truth about what kind of dangers we would face if Kamala Harris is elected as president.
We as Americans must stand together to reject this anti-freedom culture of political retaliation and abuse of power. We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future. [applause]
I am proud to stand here before you today, whether you're a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent, if you love our country as I do, if you cherish peace and freedom as we do, I invite you to join me in doing all that we can to save our country and elect President Donald J. Trump and send him back to the White House to do the tough work of saving our country and serving the people. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Well, thank you Tulsi. I heard that might happen, but I wasn't sure.
And it happened, because she's really an amazing, really an amazing person. So I look forward to working with Tulsi and everybody. Everybody in this room actually.
And as Tulsi mentioned, early this morning, Tulsi and I were at Arlington National Cemetery with the families of service members who lost their lives in the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that we withdrew, but the way they did it.
We were going to do it with dignity and strength. We were in the process of getting out. We would've never given up Bagram, one of the biggest air bases in the world, one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We gave it up. We gave it. We gave them everything. China took it over.
China now occupies it. Can you imagine? The longest, most powerful runways, I think eight feet of concrete down, and we gave it all up. Spent billions and billions of dollars years ago building it. One hour away and we're gone. And now China occupies it.
Today marks the three-year anniversary of the terrorist attack at Abbey Gate. Now, we say Abbey Gate, a lot of people don't know what that means. It means Afghanistan that left 13 American service members dead, dozens more badly wounded and many innocent civilians also killed and injured. Hundreds of people killed.
Never been anything like it. It's the wrong base. Shouldn't have taken the soldiers out first. Should have taken the soldiers out last. That's where you'd want to be. They took the soldiers out first and they had a field day at our expense and our reputation. We will never forget those brave warriors who made the supreme sacrifice for our country. They will live in our hearts forever. And to all the gold star families, our gratitude is everlasting, will be everlasting always. We will honor their memory by restoring a government that puts the American people first.
Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world. And the fake news doesn't want to talk about it. They don't even talk about the three-year anniversary. Terrible word to use, but that's what they're calling it, an anniversary. It's really, I think of anniversary is a little bit different, but it's three years now and the fake news doesn't even talk about it.
Our country will never be safe again until we have fired those responsible for this disaster. Nobody fired. Worst, most embarrassing in my opinion, the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. It gave us Russia going into Ukraine. It gave us the October 7th attack on Israel. Because it gave us lack of respect. We're not respected. We were respected very much four years ago. We're not respected now. The voters are going to fire Kamala and Joe on November 5th, we hope.
And when I take office we'll ask for the resignations of every single official. [cheers and applause] We'll get the resignations of every single senior official who touched the Afghanistan calamity to be on my desk at noon on Inauguration Day.
You know you have to fire people. You have to fire people when they do a bad job. We never fire anybody. You gotta fire them like on The Apprentice. You are fired. You did a lousy job. You did a terrible, terrible disservice to our country. You get fired when that happens. Nobody got fired. Nobody ever gets fired in this administration. It's amazing. All the bad things that have happened. Nobody ever gets fired. The problem is when you fire somebody, they always end up writing a book about you. [laughter] I've had more books written about me. I fire a lot of people when they don't do a good job. I get a book written about me by all these losers that get fired. [laughter]
Every crisis Kamala and Biden have created on the world stage can turn around very quickly and we're going to turn it around. But only we need strong leadership. We need a big victory. November 5th will be the most important day, my opinion in the history of our country. [cheers] Be the most important day. In four short years, thank you, under the Trump administration we built, you know it. You know it better than anybody. Rebuilt the US military.
We obliterated ISIS. So ISIS was going to take five years. ""Sir, I don't know if you're going to be able to do it in five years."" Five years we have those beautiful jets for $150 million apiece and they have knives and rifles. I don't understand why.
I traveled. You know that I traveled to Iraq. Late at night, I got in, I traveled. They said, ""Sir, would you do us a favor? Close your windows. We're turning off the lights. We're getting ready to land in Iraq, at a great base in Iraq."" And I went because I wanted to see why we're not winning against ISIS. We've been fighting them for 20 years. And I was told by my Washington DC generals that it will take five years. ""Five years, sir."" I said, ""I don't get it."" And I went there and I met real generals. And you know the story, you've probably heard the story, but I had one in particular, Raisin Caine. I said, ""Raisin Caine? Your name's Raisin?"" ""Yes, sir. They call me Raisin Caine."" ""What's your first name?"" ""Dan. But they call me Raisin, sir."" ""So your name's Raisin Caine?"" ""Yes."" ""I love you. This is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for Raisin Caine.""
And anyway, we sat down and we had a meeting. He said, ""Would you like to rest?"" ""No, I don't need resting. Unlike other people that we know."" [laughter] We don't need to rest. He'd rest and then leave. There'd be no meeting. I said, ""Let's go now."" I said, ""How do we beat these guys?"" ""Sir, we can do it quickly."" I said, ""No. They say it's going to take a long time. How can you do it?"" ""Four weeks, sir."" "" What?"" ""We can do it in four weeks, sir.""
They didn't use our resources. They wanted to be politically correct. They didn't fly out of areas where they thought the country may be a little angry at us, even though we support those countries and we can do it in four weeks, sir. Well, what are you going to do? We're going to have auxiliary airports—you know—military ports. You know all about them. Sort of portables.
I think he called them, but they're out in the desert all over the place. We want to use them and we'll use here. But they wanted to fly from here, and it's a long distance, sir. By the time we got there, we had to come back. I said, ""So what would you do?"" He said, ""Well, I'd leave from seven places and we'll hit them from the left. We'll hit them from the right. And we'll hit them underneath and on top. We'll hit them so much. They won't know what the hell is happening, sir.""
""And four weeks we'll do it, sir."" ""Four weeks? They said five years."" ""Four weeks is all we need, sir."" And that's what it took. Can you believe it? I said, ""Go ahead."" I made a couple of phone calls first. I said, is this guy serious? Is he serious? He did it. He knocked it out. He knocked it out. So I can tell you about some of those, what a period of time that was. And I tell that story sometimes because I want to just say, we have an unbelievable military when we have the right leader. [applause] We have an unbelievable military.
Really true. And they're not going woke. Maybe a few people on top or woke, but those guys, they'll never be aw woke. They could be put in a room and preached to for the rest of their lives and they won't go woke.
And we know them. I saw them. I saw them. What they did. I saw what they did—what they did with ISIS. We knocked out 100% quickly of the ISIS caliphate because we decided to fight. We have the greatest people in the world. We have the best equipment in the world.
Now, we did give about $85 billion worth of it to Afghanistan. You know that Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of military equipment in the world? They sell the stuff that we stupidly left there. We left them $85 billion worth of brand new tanks and planes and even goggles. They didn't fight at night. You know why? They couldn't see. Now they can fight at night. It's not even believable how stupid these people were to allow this to happen to our country, and we became a laughing stock all over the world.
And we buried 13 soldiers. They never mentioned the 45 soldiers that just were so badly hurt, obliterated, legs, arms, face. They don't mention. We left Americans behind. We left all of that equipment behind. And if we would've left from Bagram where you have hundreds of acres as opposed to a small little airport in the middle of the city where everybody just came in and it was a mess. You wouldn't have had any of the problems. But you should have again, taken the military out last.
If I asked a five-year-old child, ""What do you think?"" Here's the facts. Give him one minute. ""Would you take the military out first or?"" ""Sir, I'd take the military out last of course."" But our guys didn't do that. But I just—it's embarrassing to even talk about it. And I wasn't there. You had another group there, but it's a very big embarrassment because I love the country. I want our country to be respected. And we lost a lot of respect at that moment.
And it's so easy. It was so easy. Because we were getting out, but we were getting out with strength and dignity. Think of it. 18 months, not one soldier was killed under mine. And I spoke to Abdul. I told Abdul, ""You can't do that. Can't do it. It's going to be bad, Abdul."" [laughter] And he said, ""Your Excellency, but why do you send me a picture of my house?"" ""Oh, did I send that to you? [cheers and applause] I didn't. Did I send you a picture? Did I send you a picture? I don't remember that Abdul.""
But, and honestly, he was fine. 18 months, they were knocking out our soldiers, one by one, especially under Obama, Barack Hussein Obama. They were knocking out our soldiers one by one, snipers. We didn't have one soldier killed, even shot at in 18 months. And then these guys took over and big lack of respect.
But they had a lot of respect for us during that period. Think of that. Isn't that amazing? Not one soldier was shot at, let alone killed. Nobody killed. But I'm proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars. And the reason I started no new wars is they respected the people in this room. [applause]
It's true. You don't want to have wars. I ended wars. I could have been in a mess like you have right now. You have every place. The whole world is blowing up. And World War III, if something doesn't happen fast. And that's going to be a World War like no others because of nuclear power and other power that's out there. But we had no wars. Very proud of that.
I finished a couple of wars and I got troops out between Turkey. If you take a look, Turkey and Syria, remember we had 5,000 soldiers in between two armies, and I took them out. I said, ""Wait a minute."" I called a couple of generals, I said, ""How do 5,000 soldiers do when you have one army of 400,000 people, another army of 300,000 people, and they're in the middle, can they do well?"" They said, ""It's not going to be good, sir.""
I say, ""Get him the hell out of there. That border's been there for 2,000 years. They've been fighting over it."" The fake news back there. They hit me hard. They said, ""He removed—"" You know what happened? Nothing. They just kept it the way it's been for 2,000 years under different names and saved a lot of lives. Would've been bad.
But I did a lot of that, and I was very good at using a telephone. We didn't have to send soldiers and kill everybody, although we had some of that too. You know that. With Russia. Where they came at us, I can't do that. Came at us again. I said, ""You can't do that."" They came us at us the third time and you know what happened. A lot of people. People don't talk about it, but they know about it. And they learn not to play around with us. They learn that. Because again, we are the best. But we're not going to be the best for long if it keeps going like it is right now.
Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. I'll get it settled very fast. [applause]
I don't want you guys going over there. I don't want you going over there. And I'm the only candidate in this race who can make this promise. I will prevent—this is for the spouses. I will prevent World War III. Nobody else is going to prevent it. You're going to end up in World War III.
Look at what's going on right now with Ukraine. Their surging into Russia. Okay? You're going to end up in World War III and it's going to be a bad one.
When I'm President, America will be respected again, respected like never before. They were respected four years ago. Viktor Orban from Hungary, Prime Minister, he's known as a very tough leader, tough man, good man, but a tough man, but one of the toughest in Europe. And they asked him a little while ago, why is it that the whole world is blowing up? He says, ""because President Trump isn't the President of the United States. If he were the President of the United States, none of this stuff would be happening right now. None of it. None of it at all."" And I believe that's true. That's true. For that to have happened is crazy.
I'll take immediate action to restore our depleted military. You know we don't have any ammunition again. Do you remember when I first came in?
They said, ""sir,"" right? [Trump points at crowd member] I see that guy. Sounds like you were pretty much involved with trying to fill it up. I like that guy. I don't know who the hell he is. Stand up. Let me see. Stand up. He's like central casting, but that's—come on, stand up right there. That's good. I like that guy. [applause]
It's true, though. True. We had no ammunition. I took over. They came to me, ""sir."" ""How are we doing militarily?"" ""We have a problem, sir."" ""What is it?"" ""We have no ammunition."" That's a lousy thing.
You know, you're running a country, we got enemies, and if you have the smart President, you'll be able to do fine, but you don't want to tell your enemy you have no—I don't want to tell President Xi of China we don't have ammunition. But before that, they came out with a report, before I got there, saying that the United States has no ammunition. I said, ""Who would release a report like this?"" Even if it's true, you don't talk about it, right? We do a lot of reports that are stupid reports, like a report that came out a couple of weeks ago that we would lose in a war with China. You saw that report? We're not going to lose in a war with China.
That we would lose in a war with China, how stupid are these people that would put a report like that? If you feel we're a little weak, you gotta strengthen it up, but you don't do reports that we're going to lose to China in a war. Stupid people do that, like the people that are in office right now. [applause]
I had, and you will say it, I had ammunition. We had so much, it was coming out of our gills, right? I had ammunition I said, ""what the hell do we do with all this ammunition?"" We had so much. And now we don't have ammunition again. We gave it all away to different groups, but mostly into Ukraine, and we don't have ammunition.
We had so many missiles, we didn't know if we could fire them all. We had to hire teams of people. Even the concept, we had so much. Warehouses were full. We took new warehouses and now we're back to a point where we have no ammunition again. These people are just so destructive.
So I always look for good words, highly sophisticated, and I'm highly educated, I like sophisticated words, but there's only one word I can—stupid. They're stupid people. I'd like to say, I guess you could say incompetent sounds maybe a little better. I don't know which is better, being stupid or being incompetent because they're both. [laughter] We have no ammunition again, but we'll get it taken care of.
Boy, oh boy, can you imagine if they wanted to go after us? Can you imagine that? And we're saying they have no ammunition. This was just released a little while ago. We give so much of it away. We never get anything for it either.
Europe, by the way, is much more, and should be much more, concerned, obviously, with the Ukraine situation than us, but we've spent $150 billion more. Why do we spend 150 billion? Why aren't they going to equalize? They should equalize. I told them, I said, ""you gotta equalize it."" They don't like—then I read Barack Obama is much more popular than Donald Trump. Of course he is. He said, ""we'll spend all the money."" I say, ""you gotta pay up.""
And that's what happened. I got NATO to pay up hundreds of billions of dollars, but then now we've lost it again because nobody's—I'll bet you nobody's ever asked Europe to pay up. They don't even ask. I'll bet you that nobody said to Europe, ""we're 150 billion more than you."" They have about the same size economy when you add all of the different nations up as us, and nobody has said to them, ""gotta pay up.""
I did that. I was with NATO. They were way behind. Of the 28 nations, almost all of them were not paid. Other than that, they were doing quite nicely. Thank you. But we had seven that were paid and the rest weren't. And Obama came in, made a speech, Bush came in, made a speech. I came in and said, ""you guys owe us a lot of money"" because we were spending our money.
So think of it. They take advantage of us on trade because they are horrible to us on trade, the European nations. Horrible. They don't take our farm products.
When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in the middle of Germany? Maybe never. I said to Angela, ""Angela, do you have any Chevrolet's or Fords in the middle of Munich?"" ""No, I don't think so."" But we have plenty of Mercedes Benz's and BMW's, Volkswagen's. Millions and millions of cars.
So they get us in the military, then they get us on trade. On top of everything else. It's not a good way. I was straightening it all out. It was getting straightened out very quickly. And very interesting, though, I said, ""who would do this? Who would do this?"" Hundreds of billions of dollars we lose in the defense of Europe. All I say is, ""let's equalize. We'll help you, but you owe us 150 billion.""
And during one meeting, I remember, NATO, one of the heads of countries, I won't embarrass him by saying which one, but we had 28 countries gathered round the table, it was sort of a semi-secret meeting, which nothing secret in this world, but some of the press didn't want to report it because it was a good story. But one of the leaders stood up, said, ""does that mean—"" He wasn't paid. He owed us billions. ""Does that mean if we don't pay you, you're not going to defend us against Russia?"" I said, ""that's what it means. Are you saying you're delinquent?"" I don't know about that word. That's a real estate word. Very simple word. It means you're not paid. ""You're saying you're delinquent."" ""Yes, let's say we're delinquent. Will you defend us?"" I said, "" absolutely not."" I took so much heat from the fake news media.
Now, if I said, ""yes, I will defend you,"" they're not going to pay. What happened is hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in because I said that. [applause] Hundreds of billions of dollars came pouring in and they have money, but this should not be happening. This should not. This mess that's going on over there now is very dangerous and it shouldn't be happening. I'm the one that got them the money. Literally hundreds of billions of dollars came right in. Guys that were not paying for years.
But other Presidents never even asked them for the money. They'd make a speech and leave. Literally, I was getting ready to make a speech. I said, ""let me see some statements."" I looked at some, I said, ""nobody's paying."" We paid for everybody. We were keeping it solvent.
One of my proudest achievements on my first term was to create Space Force, the first new branch of the armed forces in over 70 years. That's a big deal. Now that Space Force is up and running, I agree with your leadership, you want this very badly, but I agree that the time has come to create a Space National Guard as the primary combat reserve of the US Space Force. [cheers and applause] Very good. Very good. Thank you. Thank you.
So as President, I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard, until I spoke to somebody that's a great guy, very much a fan of yours, Marco Rubio. I said, ""what do you think?"" He said, ""I love this. I love it. I love it."" So we're going to do that.
Space Force has been very important. Very, very important. When I did that, other people came in, they wanted to end it, and they were just hammered because people realized how important—we were getting just destroyed in space. And now we're leading. We are leading with all of the major metrics in space. Russia and China were killing us because we didn't really have a focus on it. And once you did that, we have a focus, and now we're leading in space. Throughout the Armed Forces, we will make a historic investment in building a US military for the 21st century, investing heavily in drones, robotics, artificial intelligence. Hypersonics.
You know hypersonics was us. Somebody stole the stuff and Russia ended up making them, but we're making them now. But Russia ended up making that, super speed missiles. They go about seven times faster than a regular missile, which is quite fast. And uh we're going to build a great Iron Dome for missile defense around our nation. Other countries has it. Israel has it. Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we didn't have the technology at that point. But now we have the technology, so we're going to do the Great Iron Dome, and it's all going to be built in our country. We're going to build it right here. [cheers and applause]
And as your Commander-in-Chief, I will ensure that the National Guard members have access to train on the same state-of-the-art equipment as active duty forces. We're going to make sure about that. [applause]
And I'll also get you reinforcement for allies abroad, making them pull their weight. They have to do that and they have to pay their fair share, as I was saying. And for years, all of these NATO countries spent far less than 2% of GDP on their militaries, leaving our forces overstretched. We were the ones making up the difference in paying for, to make up for shortfalls and help deter threats.
I'll insist that every NATO nation must spend at least 3%. You have to go up to 3%. 2% is the steal of the century, especially when we're paying for it. You know, we pay for them. It's just not even believable. For most NATO countries, this will represent a defense budget increase of about 30%. And of course, if you take a look at their numbers, their numbers are starting to dwindle because of all the money they're spending in Ukraine.
Starting on day one, I will confront the recruiting, retention, and moral—when you talk about the crisis that you have, you have a morale crisis because I think it's a country crisis. I think morale is about the leader of the country. I really do. I think you can only do so much. They have to be proud of our—their leader. They have to be proud of their country. They have to believe in their country. They have to believe in the American dream, or you're going to have a morale problem. And that's what you have. You have a morale problem. We will get critical race theory and left-wing gender insanity out of the armed forces and totally out of the United States military,—[applause] and we'll take care of our amazing veterans better than anybody.
In my first term, I gave the VA Choice and made it permanent. VA Choice, where you don't have a doctor. You go outside. I mean people were waiting for four months, for five months. You people probably know it. You have friends that know it very well. They go in for something that was not a big deal, and they end up being terminally ill cause they couldn't get to see a doctor, so I created and have VA Choice. They've been wanting to do it for 57 years. I got it done. Passed in Congress.[applause]
And as you know, they now go in, if they can't get rapid service, we call it Rapid Service, then they go to an outside doctor, they get themselves fixed up, and we pay the bill and it's been great. It's been great. But I understand that Biden wants to terminate it. He wants to go back to the old system where you wait for nine months and then you die. It's not even believable. No, they want to terminate it. Now, after this speech, they won't.
Every time I come in and say what really bad things, they end up—like I said, no tax on tips. It caught on like crazy. No tax on tips. This doesn't affect you guys. You're not big for tips, okay? [laughter] You don't need tips. But there are a lot of people that no tax on tips is a big deal. And I said, no tax on tips. I want two, three months. All of a sudden she's making a speech, and they were just the opposite, they were going after tip income, which is pretty hard to go after in all fairness. And she's making a speech. It goes, ""oh, and by the way, no tax on tips."" And it didn't play well for her.
But they do that now on VA Choice. You watch what's going to happen. They'll end up saying, ""oh, we want to keep VA Choice."" But they don't. They're not competent and they don't—but VA Choice has been one of the great and the others, VA Accountability. Do you know what that is? VA Accountability. The veterans had some horrible, horrible people in there. Sadists, bad people. They treated our veterans very badly because they weren't in primetime. In primetime, they wouldn't have talked to them that way, but they weren't in primetime and they were sadists and a lot of other things. Thousands. 9,000 of them. And it was a shocking act of betrayal.
It uh, we had to fire, we fired 9,000 people that were bad and we replaced them with good people. And then Kamala and Biden gutted those reforms after they got in, and they tried to reinstate many of the people that were fired for good reason, because they weren't treating our veterans. They were sadists, in many cases, vicious people. And then they gave them the option to come back or get a massive $200 million buyout. Can you believe this? Of people that treated our veterans badly?
And I had the highest number, 92% approval, from our veterans. That's the highest number by far ever. Now it's in the 40s, and it didn't take long to get there, but we had 92% approval rate from our veterans.
Upon my inauguration, we will take the sadists that Kamala Harris let in and escort them from the VA hospitals and get them the hell out of our federal buildings and away from our great men and women. [applause] Because those who mistreat our veterans will not be protected. They will be terminated. We're going to terminate them. We're going to get them out. Can't believe we have to do it. It's like I have to say it a second time.
Under Kamala Harris, American veterans are treated worse, by far, than illegal aliens. Illegal aliens are treated—you ever see them? They stay in hotels. We have veterans sleeping on the street and inside luxury hotels, you have people that came into our country, many from prisons, many from mental institutions, many terrorists, and they are treated better than our veterans. They don't care about our veterans.
As borders are, Kamala has spent over one billion of taxpayer money to house illegal aliens and foreign migrants in some of the most expensive housing and hotels anywhere in the country. Meanwhile, more than 41,000 homeless American veterans are living in squalor on our streets.
I mean I hope people are going to remember this because it's terrible. What's going on is terrible. You know, we become the Republican—I call it the party of common sense. We want to have strong borders. We want have fair elections. Like it'd be nice if somebody votes and the vote actually counts. Little things like that.
But we gotta have borders. We can't let millions of people come into a country. I called it invasion. I got the wall built by using military funds. I said, ""our country's being invaded,"" and I was able to do—we won 11 lawsuits. Everybody sued me. Crazy Nancy Pelosi sued me. She was always—she's crazy as a bed bug, that one. She's nuts. She's a nut. But at least Joe Biden likes her a lot. No, I don't think so.
Think he's angry? He fights for a year and a half in a primary system. He ends up getting 14 million votes, and they have somebody that didn't get one vote. She was let out sooner than anybody. She never made Iowa the first state. Never made it. She was the first one out of 22 people to quit, and she's now the nominee of the party. I mean, explain this, please.
When I take office, I will sign an executive order to stop every penny that Harris has been spending on the shelter and transport of illegal aliens, and we will redirect that money to provide shelter and treatment for homeless American veterans. [cheers and applause] And we will end very rapidly veterans homelessness in America. We had it down to a level that was the lowest In a long time. We would've had it knocked out, but we were interrupted.
As you know, Kamala's border Invasion has directly impacted thousands of National Guard families. I'll tell you what, African American families, Hispanic American families, their jobs are being taken. Unrelated to you, but their jobs are being taken. What's happening at our border, and she's in charge, and now she said, ""Well, I wasn't really involved too much with the border. I wasn't involved."" And even better now, she's saying, ""Oh, well, we actually had strong borders."" If they say it enough, even though we had probably 20 million people, more than 20 million people, but they figure if you say it over and over again, ""Our borders were strong, our borders were strong."" And these are people, they're not into it. Maybe like us, maybe like me, certainly.
Nobody's into it like me. I had a nice life until I did this. You know that? I had a nice, very beautiful life, but I wouldn't change it. They said, ""Would you have done it again?"" I said, ""Absolutely, because we're going to make America great again."" We already did, and we're going to do it again. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
Last Thanksgiving. I visited the southern border near McAllen, Texas, where patriots of the Texas National Guard were doing the job that Harris refused to do. She refused to do it. In fact, when our guardsmen put up razor wire and boys to stop illegal crossings, Kamala and Joe Biden, Crooked Joe, sued to take those defenses down. You know that, right? How about where they say, ""No, no, we have a strong border."" So bad. But then we find out that they flew almost a million people in over the border. They flew. That stops all of their—I shouldn't say this because if there's a debate, it would be nice to surprise it with that one. They flew. They have to have an answer to everything. ""Well, we decided, look, they flew almost a million people into our country. Our country can't handle it. No country can handle it. Our country's going to go bankrupt. No country can handle it. They're taken over the schools, they're taken over the hospitals, they're taken over everything, and they're getting jobs that were taken by other people that are not too happy.
But think of it, they flew almost a million people over everything because they were saying about how strong the border, but then they say, ""Well, what about the million people you flew?"" They have no answer for that one yet, but they'll come up with one. They always have an answer.
I want to salute every Guard member who has deployed as part of Operation Lone Star to defend America from her migrant invasion, it's what it is. Including those from Texas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, North Dakota, South Dakota, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, or as they say, Missoura[sic]. I love Missoura. I love that state. They do say it that way. Never quite understood that, but I say it that way because I won by 25 points, so I say it that way. [applause] It's true. Utah, Tennessee, Montana, Nebraska, Indiana and New Hampshire, every one of them. [applause] I want to thank them all. Thank them all.[applause]
And do not lose hope because a few months from now, you're once again going to have a commander in chief who defends the sovereign borders of the United States above all else, we have to.
Together we'll stop the human traffickers, which are horrible. They traffic in women, mostly and children, but women, mostly, and because of the internet, it's a big business. It's big business. It's going to be bigger than the drug business, they think. The internet has caused a problem. You think of it almost as an ancient crime. Human trafficking, who would imagine? But because of the internet, it's a big business and we had it down to the smallest number in 42 years, and now they come along and it's going at a level. They stuff women into the back of cars and they stuff them into trunks and bring them around and make a lot of money, and we allow it to happen.
We'll defeat the child smugglers.
We'll crush the cartels, and on day one, I will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country because we have to get the criminals from jails.
They're releasing their prisoners into our country. They're releasing their guard. You gotta see MS-13, the worst gangs in the world, MS-13, they're collecting them and dropping them into the United States. I moved out thousands and thousands of them. They're moving them into the United States. They're coming back. They're taking their drug dealers, their criminals, their murderers.
In Venezuela, crime is down 72% because they've gotten their gang members, they're dropping them all into our country, many countries. And I'm not just talking about South America. All over the world, they're dropping their criminals into our country. They're emptying their jails and they're emptying their prisons into our country. I mean, how stupid can we be? What are we doing?
And we're going to have a crime wave, the likes of which you haven't seen. You see it every day now where a person from such-and-such a country is violent at levels that nobody's ever seen before. You don't have to hear it, but at levels that nobody's ever seen before.
But what it is doing is it's making these countries, and I'm not blaming them, if you can get away with it. I'd be doing it. If I were the president of such-and, I would've done better than them. My prisons would be totally empty. They're emptying their prisons. They're taking their worst people. They're taking their real murderers, drug dealers. They're dropping them. They're taking them and busing them into the United States and dropping them, and they're saying, ""If you come back, we're going to kill you."" And these people aren't worried about being killed. They're tough. This is a tough group of people and we've got them, and nothing good is going to come out of that, and that includes a lot of terrorists.
Your choice in this election is between a president who will always have your back and a radical liberal who will never, ever, ever have your back, whether you like it or not.
In 2020, when the left-wing mobs came from all over to burn our cities to the ground, Kamala stood with the looters and rioters and raised money to bail out violent criminals all over the jails of Minnesota. She came with money to bail them out.
Kamala's running mate, his nickname is Tampon Tim, but I wouldn't say that because this group is a little more low-key than the ones I'm used to speaking before. [laughter] Tampon Tim Walz, he wants—think of this. He signed a bill mandating that every boy's bathroom has tampons in it. I don't think that's good. It's not good.
He ignored the pleas of the mayor and the police chief to deploy the National Guard in Minneapolis and said, ""You're not highly trained soldiers. You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's what he said, ""You're 19-year-olds who cook."" That's a pretty famous statement.
As president, I stood with the National Guard as you saved Minneapolis, saved Kenosha and saved Washington DC. I saved them. If I didn't override what they wanted to do and what tradition is, those places would've been—we would've lost every monument in Washington.
They came into Washington and they were very rambunctious. They liked to pull the statues down, some of these beautiful statues, and then they hit Abraham Lincoln. I said, ""All right, that's the end of that."" And I found there was a bill from the early 1900s, we don't do bills like that anymore, they said, ""If you touch government property, statues, monuments of any kind, you'll serve 10 years with no probation, no early getting out. You go to jail for 10 years."" Very simple. It was beautifully stated. It was like one paragraph and it had dust on it, it was dusty. Nobody used it because we wouldn't do that because we become very soft. They only go after political opponents. They don't do anything like—murderers, those guys are safe. Drug dealers, no problem. But political opponents they go after. So this was in very bad. It was a very old bill and I had a news conference and they were all over it.
They wanted to take down the Thomas Jefferson, the Jefferson Memorial. They wanted to take it down. They were heading that way. They were actually heading that way. We had them all stopped, but they were heading that way. It's like fighting a war. And I went out to a news conference. They announced, ""Anybody that touches any of our monuments or statues goes to jail for 10 years.""
Everybody left Washington DC. I was very lonely. They all left. I watched them. I watched their asses from the back. [laughter] That's all I could see is thousands of asses. And that stopped. We got it stopped. We got it stopped quickly. They all left immediately, and they haven't come back. Although, the other day you see them starting to do it again. They're taking the spray paint and they're spraying those gorgeous limestone tigers and all the different things. When you spray limestone, you'll see it in 100 years from now because it's a very porous stone, and they were spraying the hell out of it, and they were burning the American flag.
I want to get a law passed. Everyone tells me, ""Oh, sir, it's very hard."" You burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. Gotta do it. [applause] We gotta do it. They say it's not constitutional. They say, ""Sir, that's not constitutional."" We'll make it constitutional. We're going to make it constitutional, but you burn an American flag, you go to jail for one year. That was terrible, what happened at the convention in Chicago. They're burning American flags all over the place and the fake news doesn't want to show it.
I will proudly stand with you in defense of law and order, and we're going to have four great years in the White House. We're going to make our country very special again. I know your commitment. I know your character in conclusion, and I know your courage. As president, I saw it every year during natural disaster, national emergency, and just a few weeks ago, we saw it in the moments after an evil assassin tried to take my life.
That sucker was moving fast. I say, ""Wow, glad I got down quick, quickly."" But it was uh quite a time. It was quite a thing. Who would think? But that day, a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard was in the second row watching as the bullets flew when the shots rang out and hit a great patriot, Cory. We know now Cory by his first name, Cory, the Pennsylvania Guardsman, did not shy away. He did not run for cover. He ran toward the gunshots, took off his tie to use as a tourniquet and cradled Cory's head in his hands, and it was a tough scene. Cory died, as you know. Two other people were hit very badly, were supposed to die, and the doctors up there did a phenomenal job. They're living and they're doing okay, and although he tragically could not revive Cory, he did what every Guardsman here would have done, and it was a tough, it was a tough thing he did, to be honest, I saw that. It was a tough thing he did. Tremendous courage. Not only the bullets, I mean, just the fact he was holding this guy who really got hit.
He really got hit, but he gave his all and he was very proud to do it. America's blessed to have such extraordinary patriots, as are all of the people in this room. You put your service above yourself, and when our country needs you, you always answer the call. I know that very much. I know the people here.
That's the spirit of duty and loyalty that defines the men and women of the National Guard, and it's the spirit that is going to save our country because our country needs saving.
With your support in this election, we will reclaim our sovereignty. We will rebuild our military. We will support our police. We will stop migrant crime, which is at levels that nobody can even imagine. We will restore our economy. We'll get rid of inflation. We will protect our second amendment. We will lift up our cities, we will secure our rights, and we will defend our freedoms like we have never defended our freedoms before and we will fight, fight, fight for America. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
So just in closing, you've never let me down, never. You've always been there for me when we had emergencies, when we had a crisis, and I'm going to always be there for you and I can promise you this, together we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you all. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you, man. Thank you.

    [music: in person, Lee Greenwood sings ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Lee, thank you very much, really, and thank you, a very big thank you to Pennsylvania, we love Pennsylvania. And as I was saying—Oh, I love that chart, I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing? But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office, it was the lowest border patrol, the lowest it's ever been. Illegal immigration, today it's out of control, but I love it for other reasons too, you know that. So thank you very much and thank Lee, and what Lee has done with that song, and it's such an honor to have it. I want to just let you know that tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America.
Our movement to make America great again, stand stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and nearer to victory than ever before. We're going to make America great again [cheers and applause], going to win the election, going to win the election. And to all Americans, whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Conservative, or Liberal, or you have no label whatsoever, it makes no difference, our movement, it belongs to you, it belongs to our country, it belongs to our country. And together in just one month, we are going to usher in a new golden age of American security, prosperity, sovereignty, and freedom for our citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. [cheers and applause]
Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country, MAGA. We love MAGA. For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper's perch, not so far away, but by the hand of Providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. [cheers and applause] He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred, and destruction. Yet we are here this evening in record numbers, this is a big crowd, this is a big one. [cheers and applause] This is a big one. Not only to mark the triumph of American spirit but over, and you know that, this is really truly in the truest sense, spirit over evil and adversity, but also to pay tribute to some of the best and bravest we have ever known.
This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, a really great man, you know that. [cheers and applause] Forever afterward—
CROWD: COREY! COREY! COREY!
CROWD MEMBER: WE LOVE YOU!
TRUMP: Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American Patriots have showed and know, and they know it at a level never seen before probably. First, I want to thank the men and women of the US Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine—without even a thought for their own lives. They were on top of me so fast, they were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds. You watch those tapes, not even a moment of doubt, I want to thank Secret Service, great people, they are great people.
And in that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again, less than three weeks ago when they really did a fantastic job, another attempt, there was another attempt. We have an evil world; we have a very sick world. My gratitude to them is beyond measure. We also owe a tremendous debt thanks to the Secret Service Counter Sniper and a local police sniper—who returned fire within seconds and stopped the shooter quickly and saved many lives. If he didn't stop, he saved many lives, he had a lot of bullets, a lot of ammunition up there with him. And we are—Just amazing when you think they did it so quickly without any knowledge of what was going on, boom. And had that not happened, it would've been a very different story, it would've been many, many, potentially many, many people.
I also want to express our thanks to the Butler Township Police Department, incredible people. [cheers and applause] The Butler, Sheriff's deputies, Pennsylvania State Police, and all of the other law enforcement heroes, as well as the emergency personnel and doctors, the medical teams at Butler Memorial Hospital, Allegheny General Hospital, who rushed me and rushed some of these very badly wounded people. They were wounded, a lot of badly wounded people, and in particular, two people, two people. And I tell you, they were very brave and great people, they were big Trump fans, and they still are. That means something, that was pretty amazing.
When I got up, I asked whether or not anybody was killed. I assumed that there would be a lot because I heard the bullets winging right over my head. They said probably three, the doctors did such an incredible job. It was one, one great gentleman, but the other two have been amazing actually, they've gone through it, they've gone through a lot. And when the crisis struck, they did really Pennsylvania proud. You've heard that expression, Pennsylvania proud, it's a great place. I went to school, I went to college in Pennsylvania, it's a great place, the people are incredible.
Also, and I have to say, after returning to the field, tonight is one of the really brave Americans who was hit by the assassin's bullet, US Marine Veteran David Dutch. David, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you, David. Thank you, David. And David, we're thrilled to see your recovery is going well. Great doctors up here, I have to tell you, great doctors. Your courage is really an inspiration to us, so I want to thank you very much, David. Great gentleman, great, great gentleman. I want to send our love to someone who could not be here because he has just undergone a major surgery related to the shooting, a man who was really badly wounded like David, James Copenhaver.
Because James was a wonderful man, a big Trump fan, [applause] and Mr. Copenhaver is out there watching us right now, but he's in a hospital where they did some additional work, but he's in great shape. He wanted to be here so badly, but he's in great shape and we appreciate it and we're looking to his full and complete recovery, he will have a complete recovery. Thank you. Thank you very much. And of course, there's one more hero who could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer with us, right? You know who that is, right? Corey [Comperatore], our beautiful Corey. Corey is not with us tonight, and he should be, and we all miss him, he's become somewhat of a folk hero. I have to tell you who is with us, is his beautiful wife, and daughters, and relatives, sister. [cheers and applause] Please, where are you? Where are they sitting? [pointing to crowd] There they are. There's just a lot of people, it's not easy to find people in this audience. Goes back further than you can see. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great family, great incredible family, and he loved you a lot. And you know his wife said something very beautiful. The public, a lot of people, all of us, a lot of people have been very generous, and she said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" That's a good thing to say, that's a good thing to say. ""I'd rather have my husband.""
Corey Comperatore was a [sic] incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran, and a proud former fire chief. Very respected within the town, everybody knew him. Few men volunteered to run into fires, but Corey was one of those who did, he ran into fires. I spoke to people that were with—This guy would do anything. He was brave, right? Brave guy like you, and he was also a protector who put his life on the line for others and he loved doing it. And when the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time. In his last seconds of this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters, he didn't want them hurt. He threw himself; he knew what was happening, he didn't want them hurt, and he was hit hard, he was hit hard, and he gave his life to shield their lives. [applause]
Every father and husband in America hopes that if the time came, we would have what Corey had, tremendous courage, tremendous guts, and he wanted to protect his family, and he did protect his family. At this time, it is 6:11, 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began. I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.
[church bells ringing four times] [music: in person, Christopher Macchio singing ""Ave Maria"" by Franz Schubert]
TRUMP: Wow. Now that is what you call a voice. One of the greatest opera singers in the world, and Christopher Macchio, who's truly a great talent, is going to be back when I leave and I'm going to stay backstage watching every song he's going to sing, three or four great songs, ""Nessun Dorma"" and others. And so I wouldn't leave your seat too fast when we're finished today, but this is in honor of three great people, actually three great and in particular, Corey, and we appreciate it. But that is a real voice, isn't it, huh? That's not—what do you think, Mr. future Vice President, pretty good, right? I don't know if you could do that JD, I don't know. I don't think JD can do that.
In the face of murderous hate, Corey answered, the most selfless kind of love. We are joined this evening by Corey's incredible widow, Helen, his two precious daughters, Kaylee and Allyson. And his sisters, Kelly and Dawn, thank you so much. Thank you so much, this is an incredible tribute. [cheers and applause] This is a tribute like no other, and he deserves it. To Helen and the entire family, I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief, but I want you to know that just like you, we will carry his memory in our hearts for as long as we live.
Everybody in this stadium and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we are thinking about Corey, we think about him a lot, and I know he's looking down on us right now from heaven smiling at his beloved wife and daughters, and his mother, Karen, and his entire family, his entire family. [cheers and applause] And—he's with you and he's going to be with us for a long time because some people just don't die in vain, and what he's left behind is incredible, and so God bless you, Corey, God bless you, thank you very much, god bless you. [cheers and applause]
Just one little story. Helen told me that on the day that they came to the rally, Corey was really excited because somebody gave them great seats right up front here with the people from North Carolina, the ladies from North Carolina. This is their 227th rally, I don't know what's going on with them, [cheers and applause] those beautiful ladies, but they always seem to have good seats. But Corey had the best seat in the house, and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, ""I'm telling you; he's going to invite me up on the stage."" Because I do that sometimes, I take people, we invite them up in the stage.
And she smiled thinking it'll never happen. And little did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position, and that's where he is today. He's on the stage in a, I think in not almost, I think it's a truly immortal position. So, the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement. The love that our families have, and it's love of our communities and love of our country, it's a force more powerful than any hatred and malice because even in the darkest hours it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us. It guides us really like a candle in the night. And so it's love like Corey's that is joining us to save our country, that's going to heal our country, and that is going to reunite our country as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [cheers and applause]
So, what our opponents have never understood is that this movement has never been about me, it's always been about you, it's been about a lot of people, millions and millions of people, the biggest ever in the history of this country maybe anywhere. And everyday people who are the heart and soul of our country, they love our movement, they love our country, and they know they're doing right. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day. [cheers and applause] And now I have a great companion in JD Vance, how good was he the other night? [cheers and applause] How good? He was great.
CROWD: JD! JD! JD!
TRUMP: He was great. But from the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our country from a failed and very corrupt political establishment, very corrupt. We have to change it; we have to change it. We need also a very free and open press and to give it back to the country you believe in, and I believe in, it's a country that we were born in and the country that you deserve, you deserve this.
And that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death itself. And I believe that every citizen deserves an America with a very, very grand ambition, great opportunities, and limitless, we just want limitless potential. We want an America where you can get ahead and be proud of life and provide for your family in a really decent way, where we don't have crime, we have a fabulous military to protect us from evil. Everything has to be the best; we have to have the best schools. We have to have strong borders; we don't want bad people coming in and hurting us. We don't want to have—we don't want to have open borders, do we?
You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, that defends your sovereignty, your security, and your dignity and your freedom. You deserve a nation that builds things again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect. And we want to get respect like we had it four years ago, the entire world respected us, they respected us. They respected us more than they've ever respected us, and now they laugh at us.
We can't have them laugh at us, can we? Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interest, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, which there are a lot of them, we have a lot of them. We have a lot of them. Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me, but I've never stopped fighting for you, and I never will, never will. Never going to stop. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you. And in turn, you have always stood with me. You have always stood with me. No matter what, you saw what was going on, you saw the hoaxes and the scams, you saw everything that went on. We are a team, we're a great team, I think. We're probably the best team ever in the history of our country if you really think about it. We fought together, we have endured together, we have pushed onward together, and right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together, we bled. We've had three people that really got hit hard, two of them made it, great doctors, great doctors. They weren't supposed to make it, I wasn't supposed to make it. People said –
My great doctor at Butler said, ""Sir, you're the luckiest man alive. This would be a good time for you to go out and buy a lottery ticket. I've never seen anything like—"" I almost went out and bought a lottery ticket, I'll take it. And 31 days from now here in this great commonwealth and all across our land, we are going to win together, we are going to vote together, we're going to win the greatest election in the history of our country, maybe the greatest election all time. [cheers and applause] After we all have been through all of this together, we have—nobody's gone through what we've gone through, nobody. Because I go through it, you're going through it too, but there's never been anything like this. I always say there's an enemy from within and there's an outside enemy, and if you're smart, the outside enemy is not gonna be a problem. Russia, China, and North Korea, we're not going to have a problem if you have a smart president. If you have not such a smart president, then it's a problem, but we have an enemy from within, which I think is much more dangerous than the outside enemy.
We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country, we can make these the four greatest years. We'll turn it around so fast that your head will spin. [cheers and applause] With victory on November 5th, we are going to redeem America's promise and unlock the extraordinary future that is just within our reach, it is now within our reach. Think of it one month from today, one month. We got to get there; we got to get there. They'll drop all sorts of bombs, they'll be hitting you JD, they'll be hitting me. These people, they'll hit and hit, but I think we've almost become immune to it, haven't we? We've become immune to it, you got a little dose of it, couple of little doses. No, that's, that's the only way they can even think about winning with open borders.
Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women's sports? Who wants sex change operations [booing] for illegal aliens in holding bins? No, I don't think so. We will begin a new era of soaring income, skyrocketing wealth, millions and millions of new jobs, and a booming middle class. We are gonna boom like we've never boomed before, and we're going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including fracking like we've never fracked before. [cheers and applause] We're going to frack, frack, frack. Our opponent said, ""There'll be no fracking, no fracking, we'll never frack, we'll never frack."" Then about when she started seeing poll numbers, by the way. And by the way, speaking of poll numbers, do you mind if I mentioned poll numbers? Because I only mentioned them when they're good. I'd never mentioned it. But one that's hit me really amazingly, Rasmussen, very highly respected poll. JD, it just came out. I don't think you heard this one, but this is a shocker. They always say the Democrats will win the Hispanic vote, but we've been creeping up rather rapidly. [cheers and applause] And Rasmussen is one of the most respected polls. I mean, Republicans would get 4, 5, 6, 9, 10%. They just came out with a poll, 62% for Trump. [cheers and applause] Think of that. Think of that.
And 34% for Kamala. I don't usually use her last name. Nobody knows who I'm talking about. I go, ""Harris, Harris."" They say, ""Who's Harris?"" It's happening all the time. Who's Harris? And we can't find out who she is because if we do, our country is gonna be in big trouble. We will live in a very beautiful city or town that are safe and clean with borders that are sealed and secure.
And again, we want people to come into our country. We all want that. We need that. But you know what? We want it to come in legally. They're going to come in legally and love for our country. [cheers and applause] And America will once again be strong, and confident, and free. We're going to have that. We're going to have it strong, confident, and free. That's why I'm here today. I could right now be having a beautiful life. I don't have to be here. Instead, I could be on a gorgeous beach someplace. I have such nice property.
I could be, I could be in Monte Carlo as an example, but I'd rather be in Butler with you. [cheers and applause] I would rather. I'd rather be in Butler. And I think JD would rather be in Butler. JD?
CROWD: WE LOVE YOU! WE LOVE YOU! WE LOVE YOU!
TRUMP: No, I'd rather be here because we're doing something. They get a lot of rich guys that go, ""Nobody cares about him.""
CROWD MEMBER: We love you!
TRUMP: I had one about a month ago, very, very rich guy, and he called me up. He said, ""President—"" I've known him for a long time. I don't say how long because I don't want my wife to hear that number. It's a long time. But he's very successful. And he said to me, ""Sir, could you do me a favor?"" Guy's worth billions of dollars. He said, ""Could you do me a favor? I can't get into a restaurant. Do you think you could call them to get me in?"" And I said, ""What the hell is the good of being rich if you can't get into a restaurant?""
And I called the maître d', ""Hi,"" I'm a little embarrassed, ""Hi, this is Trump."" ""I recognize your voice."" I said, ""Would you do me a favor? A friend of mine is online about a mile back. This is a very successful restaurant. And he's got his wife."" I describe the wife. ""Could you possibly go get them? Could you go get them and bring them in?"" And he did. And my friend called me up the next day. He said, ""Thank you very much. Thank you.""
CROWD: [inaudible]
TRUMP: Oh. Doctor, please? Doctor, in the house? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor.
Take your time, doctor please. We got plenty of time, right?
CROWD: Yeah!
TRUMP: We got a lot of time.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Donald.
TRUMP: You're doing okay? –Take your time.
CROWD MEMBER: We love everybody.
TRUMP: We've got to protect our people, right? Take your time. [cheers and applause]
It's all right, doctor. Go ahead. That's all right. That's all right. People come out two, three days ago and then they get—It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. We appreciate—Everybody appreciates it. Yep. Take your time. That's great. That's great.
Do we have the greatest people in the world? We have the greatest people in the world.
First responders, thank you very much.
CROWD: [singing Francis Scott Key's ""The Star-Spangled Banner""]
O say can you, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.
And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
[chanting] USA! USA! USA!
VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP! VOTE FOR TRUMP!
CROWD MEMBER: Four more years!
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Donald!
CROWD MEMBER: We love you, Trump!
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you, doctor. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you all. Fellas, thank you. First responders, thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
CROWD MEMBER: Thank you!
TRUMP: People are here for a long time, and we appreciate it very much. And so sometimes that happens. A lot of times that happens actually. But you'll be great, you watch. So, 12 weeks ago, we all took a bullet for America and all we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes. We got to win. We can't let this happen to our country. We can't take another four years like this. We won't have a country left. We're not gonna have a country left. And all of this will be for nothing if you don't get out and vote. It will all be for nothing. We will have talked about it but –and if we do it'll be the greatest achievement, I think in the history of politics for all of us for this age because we're going to change our country around and fast.
We're gonna do things that nobody thought were possible. We're gonna do them fast. So Pennsylvania's time to stand up for America and time to save our country. This is really about saving our country. It's never been like this. When you look at the crime, look at the crime, look at the people that are coming in. Murderers. 13,099 murderers let in over the last short period of time.
Murderers that have been released from penitentiaries, prisons, jails, released into our country. Crime rates all over the world are down. They're taking their gang members and their criminals. They're taking their people in jail and they're releasing them into our country. We can't have it. You know, we just can't have it. How do you get more simple than that? They're releasing murderers. They're releasing drug dealers. They're releasing gang members and criminals. Human traffickers. Mostly they traffic in women and they're releasing them all into our country, and they're emptying their jails. And their crime rates in Venezuela are way down because you know—But it's not only in South America, it's all over the world. And Africa, the Congo.
A lot of people coming out of the Congo in Africa. They're coming out from Asia. They're coming out from the Middle East, Yemen. They're coming out from Yemen. A lot of people coming out of Yemen, and they're known terrorists, and they just release them into our country from countries unknown also. They know nothing about the people. They'll go right in. These people are crazy. And we have to win. We'll stop it immediately and we'll have to—Look, it will be a big deportation.
We're going to deport these people. We're going to get them out of our country immediately. Or we won't have a country. And if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. The whole thing will be won. So for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children, we will keep on going. And as the expression goes, I mean, I'm a little embarrassed to say it, to be honest you, but I'm going to say it because a lot of people do say it, we will fight, fight, fight.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Going to fight for our country. We're going to fight for our country.
And together we will save this country. We will restore the republic and America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer and greater and more united than ever before. Our country will be united. You'll watch, you'll watch. We had the most successful country ever, maybe in the world during my term. We are the greatest economy that we've ever had. And you know what was happening? We were uniting the other side, radical left. People were coming over. They wanted to meet. They were coming over. Women, men. If you look at population, our black population, our Hispanic population, our Asian population, everybody was doing better.
People that went to the best schools and best colleges in the world got the highest marks. And people that couldn't get a high school degree, everybody was doing better. And our country was coming together. And then we got hit with COVID, a gift from China. Some people would call it the China virus. And we did a great job on that too. We did a great job. But the world was disturbed.
$60 trillion in damage worldwide. Millions and millions, tens of millions of people killed, and we still during this four-year period, we had the greatest economy. One of the great countries of the world. And we left with the stock market that was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in. So what we did was something really incredible. But we had the greatest, most successful country ever. We had the greatest economy in our history and we're going to do it again. And maybe even better. We learned a lot. We learned a lot about people and about doing things, and what works, and what doesn't work. And we're going to do it. And it's going to be quick. It's going to be quick.
And we're going to have safe cities, and we're going to have great cities again. And we're going to have a capital in Washington, DC which is right now crime-ridden. You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; you go drive down to Washington DC and you drive down, and you end up getting murdered. You end up getting hurt, you get mugged. We are going to straighten out Washington DC. We're going to make it again, the most beautiful capital in the world.
We're not going to have graffiti. We're not going to have graffiti on our marble columns. We're not going to have roads that have potholes all over them and medians that are falling into the highways. We're going to run it properly. We're going to change it. We're going to run it properly. It's an embarrassment to us. Can you imagine foreign leaders coming in and running over roads that haven't been paved in years? We're honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build this incredible future. And he is a truly incredible guy. And I don't say that that often. [cheers and applause]
He's a great gentleman. He's done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee. His name is Elon Musk. [cheers and applause] He saved free speech. He created so many different great things. Where is he? Come on up here, Elon. He created the first major American car company in generations. And his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. Come here. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over.
ELON MUSK: Hi, everyone. [cheers and applause] As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. Well, first of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here. And you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot. Fight, fight, fight. [cheers and applause] Blood coming down the face.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
MUSK: Now America is the home of the brave. [cheers and applause] And there's no truer test than courage under fire. So who do you want representing America?
CROWD: TRUMP!
MUSK: Yeah, absolutely. And I think this election, I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms. They want to take away your right to vote effectively. You got 14 states now that don't require voter ID. California, where I used to live, has just passed the law, banning voter ID for voting. [booing] I still can't believe that's real. So how you supposed to have a good proper election, if there's no ID. It's just meaningless. And free speech, free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it's the First Amendment. And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. [cheers and applause] President Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.
CROWD: WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP! WE WANT TRUMP!
MUSK: Yes. This is a must-win situation, must win. So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone in the live stream, there's one request. It's very important. Register to vote. Okay? And get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, you drag them to register to vote. There's only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona. 48 hours. Like, text people now, now. And then make sure they actually do vote.
If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction. Nothing is more important. Nothing is more important. So get everyone you know. So I'm speaking to people out there. Everyone in the crowd I think is already convinced. But for people out there that are watching the video, watching the live stream, you need to get everyone you know at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything, get them to register to vote right now. Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona. Only a couple of weeks left in Pennsylvania. And if they're not registered to vote, it doesn't matter at that point. Register to vote. I'm being repetitive for a reason. So nothing is more important. And a lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count. Well, it does. Okay? It does. It matters. And this election could be decided by a thousand votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin. So get everyone you know to register to vote. I believe it's swampthevote.com. I believe that's the site. Double check that your registration is good. Don't take it for granted.
I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway more than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then getting everyone you know to actually vote. That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] So thank you. And honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone you know. People on the street, everywhere. Vote, vote, vote. Fight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: What a great guy. And he'd rather be making rocket ships because he'd really rather do that. Nobody better. I think he's got 90% of the rockets that go up. But Elon, thank you very much. Incredible, incredible. What he says is true. [cheers and applause] What he says is true. We're all having fun here tonight. But if we don't register and if we don't vote, we're just going to look upon this as another sort of nice day in our life. But it won't even be a nice day. We're going to look back and we're going to say, ""Wow, it's a lot of time, a lot of effort. We got to win."" If we don't win, it's as he said, it's just not important. We have to save our country. So you have to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. You got to get your friends and vote because they play a lot of tricks this particular other side.
Elon is a very nice guy. He doesn't want to say it, but they play a lot of tricks. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen again. We can't let it happen. And one thing, they showed us how bad they are, they showed us how bad a job they do. So that's one thing we got from this four years. They've done the worst job. It's the worst president in the history of our country. It's the worst vice president in the history of our country. And if you watched over the last couple of days, they are doing—This is a Katrina for them.
This is one of the worst. They say it's the worst job ever done on helping people through the ravages of a hurricane. And they're watching—She's out there, out there campaigning in San Francisco, a place that she ruined. Okay? She ruined. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined—Think of this. She ruined San Francisco. She was the worst DA. And she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America. We can't let her do it.
So, I called Elon to tell him that they needed Starlink as an example. They couldn't get Starlink. I didn't know what Starlink was. I must tell you. Elon, I'm so embarrassed. I didn't know what the hell Starlink was. He loves Starlink. He can tell you every little screw that's needed, every wire. Me, I didn't know. But when I was in North Carolina and Georgia just the other day, yesterday to be exact, but they were saying, we have tremendous communications especially in North Carolina. And we have tremendous problems. We have no communication. The poles were ripped down, the wires were underwater, houses were destroyed.
Possibly a thousand people. Maybe more will be. There's 600 people missing. Missing is not good. Because you know what missing means generally. That's really bad. And they had no communication. They had literally no communication with, they called it the mainland because the water was so crazy. It was like they were in the middle of a lake, and they'd never seen anything like it. And they said, ""Do you know somebody named Elon Musk?"" I said, ""Yeah, I happened to know him a little bit. He just endorsed me actually.""
Well, he endorsed me a long time ago, but he still—To me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon. Nobody is smarter than Elon. And they said, ""Could you do us a favor? Could you help us? We're trying to get Starlink and it's very hard to get. Most people say you can't even get it."" I called up Elon. I said, ""North Carolina is in big trouble. Georgia is in big trouble. They need communication."" They have none because their poles have been knocked down and their wires are underwater and even dangerous. dangerously underwater. But they have no communication. Elon, could you do something about Starlink? Whatever the hell that is, Elon. Whatever, Starlink. That's all they want to hear is Starlink.
And an amazing thing happened. I got a call from one of the top people in North Carolina. I got a call from another great person in Georgia. And I wasn't finished with my phone call yet, and they got word that Starlink would be delivered to the States. I said—No. And I said, ""What the hell is he—What kind of a system is that? Normally you'd have to hang up and he'd go and call people."" He did it during the phone call. What kind of a system do you have? That's why he's a very advanced, he is a very advanced person, but I want to thank you, Elon because I got it. And I said, ""How does it work? Two days later, how does it work?"" They said, ""Much better than the wires.""
So now I'm saying, ""Why the hell aren't they—You're going to come out very well anyway."" And he also said, ""You don't have to pay me. You pay someday when you get the money back. You don't have to pay me."" He wanted nothing. He's a great guy. Thank you, Elon, for being here. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. Great honor, great honor.
CROWD: ELON! ELON! ELON!
TRUMP: Thank you, Elon. And that's heartfelt. I can't even see the end. That's a lot of people here today. We're also joined by a great gentleman, a top, top, brilliant student. He went to a tremendous college, and he graduated right at the top of his class in two years. I didn't know you could do, that's four-year college. Then he went to the military then he came out and he did fantastically inside the military. Then he came out, he went to Yale without the benefit of family ties. You know what that means? Right? That's pretty good without family ties. I don't know too many of those people. They had no family ties. He got in. He can't get in, and he graduated along with his wife. They're not going to have any problems with your kids academically. I can tell you.
His wife and him were like the top students in the class. But he went to Yale Law School and then he went out into the private sector, did great. Then he ran for the senate, and he did fantastically. He won. And he's like a rocket ship. He's like one of Elon's rocket ships the way his career is going. But you see why? Because he's a really brilliant guy. And you saw that the other night in the debate. Right? You saw that the other night in the debate. [cheers and applause] You know the expression they have? If that were a fight, they would've stopped it. Right?
So, I just want to thank JD. I was always confident in that pick. And we had great people too, JD. Every—Every one of those guys were great. Every one of them would have done a great job. It was amazing. But we appreciate the job you're doing. He's also very energetic, and he'll go on anywhere. He'll go on MSDNC [sic]. I say, ""Oh, he's done that."" He'll go on CNN. He has no problem. He swats them like this. He has no problem. No, it's true. Other people say, ""Sir, I'd rather not do that one. I'd rather not do that one, sir. I'd rather not do them,"" because they are very—With him, he doesn't care. He says, ""They're not going to outsmart me."" So, I want to thank JD. You've done a great job. Thank you very much. Amazing. Great.
CROWD: JD! JD! JD!
TRUMP: We have a lot of senators and a lot of people from Congress. I'm going to introduce a few of them that are really outstanding, and they are warriors and they're great Patriots. Senator Eric Schmitt. Where's Eric Schmitt? He's around here someplace. Nice, tall, handsome guy. Thank you, Eric. What a great job you've done. He helps us so much with the Senate, and we've got a great Senate. We have to get a couple of more senators elected. I think it's going to happen, too. I think it's going to happen.
We have members of Congress here, Dan Meuser. Dan? Where's Dan? Great, great job. Real warrior. These are warriors. Guy Reschenthaler. That's the hardest name in the Senate to pronounce, but I've learned how to pronounce it. Guy, thank you very much. Great. Where's Guy? Guy? Thank you very much, Guy? Glenn G.T. Thompson. Fantastic guy. Thanks, Glenn. Great job. John Joyce. Thank you, John. Great. Cory Mills. He's out there fighting, too. [cheers and applause] He's out there. He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia. He's out there helping people.
Mike Waltz, who's a tremendous national security asset. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Okay. And a man who was my doctor, I got to know him as a doctor in the White House, right. And then before that, he was actually an Admiral. And then he went to the White House. He was a great Admiral. He was a great doctor, and I love him for one reason. They asked him in the White House. The press, the fake news media said, ""Who is the most—"" He was the doctor for Obama, Bush, and Trump. That's pretty good, right? White House doctor for the three of us.
He said, the press, ""Who is the healthiest of the three?"" He said, ""Definitely, it's Donald Trump. There's not even a contest."" And I love that guy. JD, when he said that, I said, ""I like this guy."" So then he said, ""You know, sir?"" He was leaving the White House. He said, ""You know, I'd love to run for Congress."" He ran against 28 people. They were all running for the Republican primary because whoever won that primary is going to win. I think it's a Trump plus 48. Whoever wins gets 48-point start.
And not only did he win, he won easily, and now he's one of the most popular people in Congress and one of the most talented, maybe more importantly. Ronny Jackson. [cheers and applause] Ronny? Where is Ronny? Where is you? Oh, good. Thank you, Ronny. You got a lot of talent surrounding you there. I think it's very important, also. We're here for a reason, and that's to win and to honor Corey, but Corey wants us to win, too.
There's a man in the audience that's been very much a career path a little bit like JD, great student, great, talented student, and fantastic in the military, then went out to be a tremendous success, one of the most successful people on Wall Street, actually. And he's tough, and he's smart. He's going to make sure you always have fracking in Pennsylvania, and he's going to make sure you have many other things other than fracking.
You have a senator that now does nothing. He does nothing, and he doesn't fight for you. He votes with Biden, if you can believe it, 100% of the time. But this guy, we're lucky that he does it. I don't know. He might not have done it if he had it to do again. I don't know. But I think he's just one of the most outstanding people anywhere in the country to run for office, and we're lucky that he's doing it. And he's got a real shot. He's doing very well in the polls.
It's hard to beat somebody that's been there a long time, but this is somebody that's been there a long time and did nothing. He did nothing. His name is David McCormick, and he's great and I hope he's going to be your next senator. [cheers and applause] I see somebody else. I didn't know he was here. Mike Kelly. I see Mike Kelly here. [cheers and applause] Stand up. Oh, boy, am I lucky. Am I lucky I spotted him. If I didn't spot you, Mike, I was in big trouble, right? This is a man who's beloved in this state, and he's fantastic. So thank you, Mike. Thank you.
We also have some terrific people from law enforcement, Butler County Sheriff Mike Slupe. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Mike. Great job. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you for your help, too. I could tell you. Thank you for your help. I can say that. Thank you very much. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Osche. Leslie, thank you. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Leslie. Great job. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, this guy is doing a great job. [cheers and applause] He's doing great. Came from North Carolina. We won North Carolina.
He kept their cheating down to a minimum, and we were able to win it. We were solid all night long. He's great, but if we don't have good results by the 6th of November, I will never say that about him again. [laughing] No, he's a great guy. He's working very hard. 24 hours a day, he's working. I know that. He's working mostly on Stop the Steal because we have a lot of votes. We have plenty of votes. Stop the Steal. That's why you've got to get out. You've got to get out and vote. We're going to win this thing.
The more we win it, it's too big to rig, the expression we use. Make it too big to rig. Elon would understand this better than anybody. Statistically, at a certain point, their cheating doesn't matter. We want to make it too big to rig. We also have somebody that's very special, the co-chair of the Republican Party, Lara Trump. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Lara, thanks.
And you know, oftentimes with families, they say, ""Oh, why did you put that one in or this one in?"" And all the different people, so many people have problems with that. In her case, everyone said, ""How the hell did you get her to do it? She has been unbelievable."" So, thank you very much. Comes from North Carolina, and I have a feeling she's going to be spending some time down there a little bit. And she's married to my wonderful son, Eric, who's right here. So, Eric, please stand up. [cheers and applause] He's a great guy.
Eric has a distinction. He has gotten more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country by about 10 times. Every day Congress would meet, they'd send him a subpoena. What is it about? They have no idea. But I think he's got the all-time record, and he's handled it all beautifully. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. A friend of mine, a great, great businessman, one of the most respected people, and he made a big, big contribution yesterday to Georgia and a big contribution to North Carolina. Steve Witkoff is here. [cheers and applause] Hi, Steve. Thanks.
And another man who's one of the greatest businessmen in the country, he actually said that ""If Trump doesn't win, this country is going to go into a massive depression."" Well, I don't know about that, but he has been a very good predictor, I will say that, and truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker meaning stocks. He knows what he's doing and highly respected by everybody. John Paulson. Thank you, John. [cheers and applause] Great. Great guy.
Now, we have so many others, and I won't do it because we have to really get out of here before it gets too cold for people, but I just—I love it much better because there's one teleprompter, not that I use the teleprompters too much. Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter? [cheers and applause] No, we don't need it. We don't need it. But this one was right smack in the sun. Great job back there, fellas. They said, ""The teleprompters are working fine."" Well, thank goodness.
Did you see what happened the other day with the teleprompter with her [Kamala Harris]? That was not a pretty sight. The teleprompter went off, and she went off, too. She didn't know what the hell happened. And you know, teleprompters are very dangerous because they go off a lot. You have to be prepared for them to go off, cold blank. You'll have 100,000 people. You have 75,000 people. You have this. If the teleprompter goes off, you got to be able to move. She did not move well. This was not a good situation.
But three more heroes from July 13 who rendered first aid to Corey incredibly, Dr. Jim Sweetland, Rico Elmore, who was unbelievable. [cheers and applause] Rico, you were unbelievable. He ran over National Guard. He ran over and grabbed Corey, and Corey was still living. He was doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a man who was really in bad shape like nobody's ever seen. His family appreciates it, and I do, too. So thank you, Rico, very much. Right? Amazing, amazing.
Amazing the people that we have. You learn about them under times like this. That's when you really learn. So we're going to be seeing Rico again. Ed Shear, fantastic job. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Ed. We appreciate it. Thank you, Ed. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ed. Great job. In addition, this evening, we have to send our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene. This has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable.
Those people, I was there yesterday with North Carolina and Georgia. I'll tell you. By the way, the governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job, excellent job. But we have other people that aren't doing a good job, and we have to have them do a good job. But the federal government is doing a very bad job. They are not doing the job, and we have death and destruction that we haven't seen maybe ever. It's a real bad one. They have to get people there because they don't have people there. They don't have the people.
Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina, no helicopters, no rescue. It's just what's happened there is very bad. They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They're offering them $750. They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed. The one young lady washed—You saw that with her son. I wish I never saw it, but just washed away. Your son was washed away with the grandparents. So sad.
They're offering them—giving them $750. Think of it. We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars, and we're handing North Carolina $750. If you want a president who won't even try to save you when the floodwaters are rising, vote for Kamala. She's not the right person. Look, you know what? If they were—if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run, to be honest with you. I didn't need to do this. I didn't need to. If I thought they were doing an even modestly good job, I wouldn't have run.
But I saw right from the beginning, grossly incompetent, and I was right about that. I decided to run, and we're doing really well. I was telling you about polls. We're way up in some polls. We're up in other polls. And with the swing states, I think most of them have us up in every single swing state, including the great commonwealth of a place called Pennsylvania. Don't ever not call it a commonwealth because I've seen people call it a state, and that's the end of them. That's practically the end of their political career.
You got to be very careful with Pennsylvania. It's that commonwealth. I haven't made that mistake. I don't want to either. It was not a pretty picture. If you want a president who will stop at nothing to protect you and your family, I hope you're going to vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? [cheers and applause] Together, we will rebuild western North Carolina, rural Georgia, and every other state that's been so badly affected. That includes Alabama.
Virginia was very hit hard. South Carolina was hit very hard, Florida, so many states, Tennessee was hit really hard. They were all hit, and we're going to work with them. And you know, the next president is going to be the one that really once they get—They got to get this done. But once that happens, the next president is going to be the one that has to really help them. JD will be there to help them. I know that.
2024 is the most important election in the history of our country, and here are the facts. My opponent, Kamala Harris, is the most incompetent and far-left nominee ever to run for president. You know, she's much further left than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know that. She wants to open borders. She took the most secure border in US history and turned it into the worst border in the history of the world. Remember, she was appointed border czar. She says she wasn't now after three years, but she was. But whether she was or not, she was in charge of the border.
And the other day I saw her get up and say, ""We will do this. We will do that."" Why didn't they do it four years ago? Why didn't they do it? The damage is so bad and so—It's been done. She let in 21 million illegal aliens from all over the world, from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums. There are terrorists at record levels, at levels we've never seen before.
She costs you $29,000 a family through inflation price hikes, and now she wants a larger tax hike in—She wants to go to the largest tax hike in American history. There's never been a tax hike like what she's proposing. She's going to raise your taxes a minimum of $3,000. She's a big taxer, and she was the original creator of Defund the Police. I think for all the sheriffs over here, if you're a partner in Defund the Police for even two days, you cannot be president.
But she was one of the founders of Defund the Police, and she still believes that, by the way. I don't know how anybody could, but she still believes that. If she ever had a chance, there's a good possibility she'd go back to it. Can you imagine somebody's robbing our house? Well, there's nothing we can do about it. They tried it. You know where they tried it? In Minnesota with our vice president and it wasn't working out too well. It was working out very well for the robbers and the criminals. That's the only one it was working out well for.
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for illegals. And worst of all—This is maybe the worst thing in the whole—that nobody talks. The fake news won't mention it. She lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in slavery, or just plain missing, probably never to be seen again, never to see their parents again. But this isn't like—This is 325,000 have been lost.
She praised the idea of a 70% to an 80% tax rate. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing your energy workers and your pricing. You know, you have one of the highest energy costs in the country, and yet you're sitting on top of a massive amount of energy that she doesn't want to get. It's been a disaster for your state. Now she's vowed repeatedly, now all of a sudden, she changed her mind.
With politicians, it's always the first statement that comes out to be the one they want. So she's spent 14 years knocking fracking. ""We're never going to have fracking. We're not going to frack."" All of a sudden, a little while ago, she came out, ""I love fracking very much."" No, she'll go back to it. And she even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. I don't think Elon likes that idea. These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.
And it was just announced yesterday in California. He took this one from me. I'm so upset. But think of it, that the far less than average governor, Gavin Newscum [sic], has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote. You're not even allowed to mention the fact, Elon. You're not allowed to mention the fact. You can't say, ""May I see your ID?"" If you do, it's a criminal act. This like—this is a takeover of the country. You're not allowed to ask for an ID. If you do, it's a criminal count.
Other Democrat states are following. This is only so they can cheat. There's only one thing that you do this for, so that you can cheat on elections. There's no other conceivable reason. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist. She is a woman that's not respected in Congress. She was laughed at at [sic] Congress. Nobody thought she could win. They did a coup of Biden, whether you like him or not. I'm not a particularly big fan.
But we had a debate, and debate ended. And all of a sudden, they come to him, and they say, ""We want you out. You're not going to win the election."" He said, ""I don't want to get out."" He got 14 million votes, if you believe in democracy or the system. He got 14 million votes, and she got none. She was the first one out, 22 candidates, and she never made it to Iowa. She quit before Iowa, and now she's running. And that's okay. But we spent $150 million beating Biden.
As soon as he was down and out for the count, they say, ""Let's take him out. We'll get somebody else to run."" Never happened before. We do a lot of firsts. I will tell you. We do a lot of firsts. But she's a person that rated even worse in every statistic than any other senator. She was rated at the bottom of the US Senate. She's destroyed everything she touched, but the good news is that we have a plan to fix it. We're going to fix it, and we're going to fix it fast.
Nobody is going to stand for open borders. Nobody is going to stand for a bad military. Nobody is going to stand for education that's not proper. We're moving education back to the states. [cheers and applause] You're going to be running your own—Education is so important. What's more important than education? But we rank at the bottom of every list. They rank 40 major countries. We're at the bottom, but we're top of the list as the cost per pupil.
We spend more per pupil, per student, than any other country anywhere in the world. So, we're number one in that, and we're number 38, 39 or 40 every single time. And you have Denmark. You have Sweden. You have Norway. You have China's always the top five. Can you believe it? China's the top five. [booing] That's amazing. But we're going to move our education back to the states, so places like Indiana and Iowa and Idaho and states that you don't even hear too much of because they're so good and so well-run, they're going to run their own education. You know what's going to come out of that? A Denmark, a Norway, a Sweden. Maybe, I don't even know, China. Can you imagine? China with 1.4 billion people is a top five and we're close to 40. We are 40 sometimes.
Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion into our country. [cheers and applause] We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower right now has that record.
And by the way, it's not something I want to do. I dread having to do it, but we have no choice. What they've done to our country is not even believable, especially the criminals, the criminal element that's in our country. And again, all over the world, crime rates are down because they've taken their criminals, and they've dumped them into the United States. And you know what? I would have been worse than them. I would have had it done even faster.
They've dumped them into the United States of America, and that's what we have. It's dangerous out there. We're getting them out. We're getting them out quickly. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again. It's going to start with liquid gold. [cheers and applause] We have more liquid gold, oil and gas, under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.
We will become energy-independent like we were just four years ago. Four years ago, we were energy independent. Can you believe it? And then we were going to become energy-dominant. We will be dominant within a matter of months, and we will make so much money. We are going to drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We will again open ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to do it. Every single president from before Reagan tried to do it, and I got it done.
ANWR is the largest drilling site anywhere in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than Russia. It's in Alaska. I got it done, and we worked to get it done. One of the first things he did was terminate ANWR, and that was going to take care of all of Asia. That was going to make us so much money. We would have paid off debt. I gave you the biggest tax reduction in history. You would have gotten even a bigger one. You were going to be just very happy. You were going to say, ""I like that guy very much.""
20 million Americans are behind on their electric bills right now. It was just announced. 20 million Americans, they're struggling to pay their monthly bills at a record rate. There's never been anything like it. And it's all because of their anti-US energy regime, which has caused Pennsylvania electricity prices to raise almost 50%. We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months.
We will have your prices, your air conditioning, heating, cars if you buy a Tesla, which is good. Woo [sic], it's good. We will have your energy prices cut in half. It'll be cut in half within a period of one year from January 20th, which is the day we take office. That's going to save you a lot of money. That's going to bring down the prices of everything because more than anything else, people tell me about the groceries, the groceries, our groceries.
And what they're talking about is food. Everything's going to be coming down when we do that. We're also going to get your interest rates way down. We will bring automobile manufacturing back to the United States at levels never seen before, and we will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower again. It hasn't been there in many, many years. [cheers and applause] We had it started four years ago.
The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate. In other words, if you make your product in the United States, you get a rate. So, I cut it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said that was impossible. I got it done, and we had the best boom we've ever had. We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39. Think of it. Much more. The following year we did much more.
And then I'm going to take it from 21 to 15, which will make us the most competitive country in the world. [cheers and applause] Nobody will be able to compete with us. But that 15 rate only goes for those who make their product in America. They have to make their product here, otherwise, they pay 21. We will protect those companies moving into America, and all of our existing companies, with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don't move in.
If they don't come in, if they don't want to make their product here, that's fine, but they're going to be tariffed. We have to protect our companies, and that's what we're going to do. The only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories in America. We may even be able to get Elon to build some of them. I think we will. [cheers and applause] And hire American workers for the job. We're gonna hire American workers for the job.
We will pass the Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country charges us 100 or 200% tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200% tax. We had a lot of problems on that one with the Senate, and we're going to get that done. Think of it. They charge us, and we don't charge them. Now, they charge us. We're going to charge them the same thing, reciprocal. It's reciprocal.
I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our auto workers who will better than they have ever done. We're going to bring back the car business like it was 50, 60, and 70 years ago. [cheers and applause] Everyone's going to want to be back here. I will not approve Japan buying US Steel, 70 years ago, the greatest company anywhere in the world. It was the greatest company anywhere in the world, and now we have Japan buying US Steel. I don't like that.
We will deliver massive tax cuts for workers, and we will have a policy that I think is so great, no tax on tips [cheers and applause], no tax on overtime [cheers and applause], and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, no tax. When you think of it, our seniors were hurt so badly. Inflation has killed our seniors. They have a fixed income, and it just got worse and worse every week. Every month, it's gotten worse and worse, and it's just horrible. They haven't gone down. They've only gone up. Prices have still only gone up.
While working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates at 10%. [cheers and applause] People are paying 28% interest, 25% interest. I will always protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts. We're not going to do anything with Social Security, but they're going to destroy Social Security because all of the migrants coming in are going on between Medicare, Social Security, other programs, and nobody is able to afford it.
I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent, I promise you, World War III. [cheers and applause] We're not going to have World War III. Right now, we're very close to having it. We will lead the world in space exploration. Thank you, Elon. We will lead the world in military, and we will reach Mars before the end of my term. Elon promised me he was going to do that. I don't know. Can you do that? Stand up. Can we do that?
I think he's going to do it. JD, work on him. Work on him. Work on him. JD is working on Elon. No, he told me that we're going to win, and he's going to reach Mars by the end of our term, which is a big thing, before China, before anybody. And my money's on that guy right there.
We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. [cheers and applause] It's losing right now. It's losing right now. But I'll be able to do it. Other people won't. I'll tell these countries, as they leave us on the—I say, ""You want to do business in the United States? You're going back into the reserve currency. And if you don't, we're going to charge you a big, fat, beautiful tax to do business in the United States."" And they're going to say, ""I would love very much to go back into the US reserve currency."" No, we're going to save it. But these people aren't going to save it. They don't know how to talk. They don't know how to think.
Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a beautiful car, and a home. [cheers and applause] Very basic. It's very basic. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insaniticy [sic], we're going to keep it the hell out of our school. [cheers and applause] We're going to keep that insanity out of our school. And as I said, we will keep men out of women's sports. So demeaning to women.
You saw that in the Olympics. They have female boxing, women's boxing, and a young lady from Italy, very good boxer, very, very good. She was all excited. But she played a person who transitioned, person transitioned, a male transitioned to a female, and the young girl from Italy, beautiful young woman, I'm not allowed to say that anymore politically, but I'll say it, she was a beautiful young woman. If you say that, that's the end of your career, right? But it's not. If it is, so be it, okay? We've got to get back to real life. But this beautiful young lady is out, and she gets, boom [gestures punching], a little jab, left jab, and she goes back, ""Oh my God, I've never been hit like that. This is just like a defensive."" Then he goes, the corner said, ""You can take her!"" So, they push her out. Boom, another one. And she says, ""That's enough, I can't do it. I can't take it."" I've never seen anything like it. So, we had two people that transitioned. Both people, shockingly, won the gold medal in their division. So, it's crazy. [booing]
And if you look at weightlifting contests, they're the best of all. For years and years and years ago, they put an eighth of a pound on one side of the barbell, an eighth of a pound on the other. And they can't do it! And the record's standing for 18 years, they just can't do it. And then a guy comes along who never lifted before, and he puts a hundred pounds on, and he goes like this [gestures lifting barbell], like it's nothing. It's so demeaning to women. We're not going to allow it to happen. It's ending. No men playing in women's sport.
And we will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. We need hope. We need the American Dream back, don't we? We're going to have the American Dream. We're going to have the American Dream, so every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, ""I want to be like Elon Musk. I want to have $200 billion in cash. I'm going to be like Elon Musk."" Get to it. That's the American Dream.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country-destroying radical left agenda once and for all. We cannot have it happen. So, you must get out and you must vote. Here in this incredible Commonwealth, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots, who gave everything they could give, every single thing, for their rights and for their freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence and sounded the beautiful Liberty Bell. It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. And where generations of top, strong, beautiful miners and steelworkers put Pennsylvania spirit into every single thing they did. [cheers and applause]
And from Gettysburg to Germantown, and Philadelphia to Barren Hill, and from Brandywine to right here in Butler, this is the place where Pennsylvania patriots poured out their blood with the love of their country. They love their country so much. And so, in honor of all those American heroes who came before us, we will press forward, we will push onward, and together we will win, win, win. We're going to win, win, win. [cheers and applause] Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles we must face, we will keep striving toward our magnificent American future. We will not fail; we will not allow ourselves to fail.
From this day forward, we will always put America first, and we'll take back and save the United States. November 5th, election day, will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, with the great people of Pennsylvania, we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause] We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause] We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania.

[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Well a very, very big hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And it's great to be back in this beautiful commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. You are indeed. You are hardworking, proud. You love the country. We're going to save our country. We are going to save it from these lunatics. Before we begin, I want to send our prayers to the people of Florida getting hit just about now. In a little while, you're going to see a hurricane like we haven't seen in a long time, as well as all of the people still recovering from Hurricane Helene. So we have–North Carolina's been hit very hard and this administration has not done a proper job at all. [booing] Terrible, terrible. Nobody's seen anything like it, but we just pray for everybody. We want them all to be good and we're going to be there hopefully soon, and we're gonna help them rebuild and get it all back together. And we hope that God will keep them safe. God will keep them safe. Just 27 days from now, we're going to win Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We're going to defeat Kamala Harris and we are going to make America great again. And when we beat—Well you know this. When we win, it will be, I believe, the greatest political victory in American history. I believe it will. [cheers and applause] It will be the greatest. We had an incredible evening on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We love Butler. Butler's become a very famous place, celebrating the brave firefighter and fire chief. We love Corey [Comperatore], right? Who sacrificed his life in the attack 12 weeks ago. Just take a look at all of the incredible patriots. You have to see this to believe it. Over 100,000 people. Take a look at this. [cheers and applause]
[video plays of crowd at a ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Butler, PA on 10/5/24]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you. Who is that man up there? I don't recognize him. Who is that? From the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment and to give you back the country you believe in, the country you were born in, and the country you deserve. You're going to get it back. We're all getting it back. In that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, and I will never, not ever, under any circumstances, even in the face of death, we will never give up. Never going to give up. We're going to turn it around. We're going to have the four greatest years we've ever had. I'm putting everything on the line to fight for you. I didn't have to be here. I could be in a beautiful beach. I could be in a gorgeous beach somewhere in the world.
The sun beaming down on this beautiful body in a bathing suit. [cheers and applause] The sun would be beaming down, the waves would be crashing into my face. Instead, I'm here with you in Pennsylvania and I'd rather be doing that. [cheers and applause] [stepping away from microphone] It's true, I'd rather be here.
And all I want is one thing, because we're going to do this. You have to go out and vote. [cheers and applause] That's all. That's all I want. You don't even have to give us any money. That's a pretty good deal, right? Just vote. Vote for all of us. You're not voting for me, you're voting for all of us. We're going to save our country. It's being run by incompetent people that have no idea what the hell they're doing.
Early voting is underway now. So when the polls open tomorrow, don't wait. Go immediately. Go as soon as you can. If you want, you go. Some people want to wait, they want to wait till that beautiful Tuesday that day that's going to be the most important day in the history of our country, I believe. You know, I really believe that. I think we're going to win Pennsylvania. We're leading in all the polls. I shouldn't tell you that. [cheers and applause] I shouldn't tell you. I should say we're down one, we're down one. Get out and vote.
No, we're doing well in Pennsylvania. We're doing well in Michigan. We're doing well in Arizona, Nevada. We're doing well everywhere. We're doing well in places that a Republican hasn't won in years. We're doing well everywhere because people are looking at the people that are destroying our country and they say, ""We're not going to take it anymore."" If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing. It's over. [cheers and applause] Right? The whole thing. But really nobody makes the case against Lying Kamala Harris better than Kamala herself. Take a look.
[shows video clip]
ANA NAVARRO: Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of—and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. [booing]
[end of clip]
TRUMP: So think of that. So I heard that question when it was given because I had a watch, because she doesn't do any interviews. She doesn't do any press conferences. She doesn't do them for one reason. She's not smart. She's not smart. Not smart. No, she doesn't do them. They're trying to shield. Last time they kept a man in the basement and they had an excuse. They had a thing called COVID around. And we did great last year, I want to tell you. We did great in 2020. We did great in 2016. But we got millions more votes in 2020. Think about that one. So we have to make this too big to rig, right? Too big to rig. [cheers and applause]
So Kamala just said that she can't think of one thing she'd do differently than crooked Joe Biden, right? I'll read off a little list to you. How about the following? She wouldn't do one thing. Remember that. What about the nation-wrecking border invasion, 21 million people? [booing] 21 million people plus came into our nation, and among them are murderers, drug dealers, people from mental institutions, human traffickers, mostly in women. How about that? She wouldn't do that differently? She went from the best border in the world to the worst border in the world. She went from—we had a border that was the best in US history, and now we have the worst border anywhere in the world at any time. There's never been a border like this. What she's done and what he's done, what they have done to this country. The worst inflation in the history, costing a typical family almost $30,000, the inflation, she wouldn't do that over again either.
Maybe the worst of all, and something that a lot of people don't hear about because—Look at all the fake news. That's a lot of fake news. [booing] I think this is the worst of all in a sense. And you'd almost say, how could it be worse? She lost 325,000 migrant children. Their parents are looking for them. Think if you were their parents. Think if you with their parents, 325 due to incompetence, due to the fact that she had the worst border, due to the fact that she let our great people not run the border. She got rid of all the things that we were doing. We had the safest border. We went from the safest to the worst. Those children are now dead, in slavery or just plain missing. Probably most of them will never be found again. Think of that 325,000 because of their incompetence. They're missing. Probably many of them are dead.
Number four, migrant flights, flying illegal migrants into our cities. Remember when she said, ""No, we want to—"" About a month ago, she realized this was not playing well for her and the polls. So they came up with a phony little idea that they'll do something. The only thing they didn't do, though, they didn't stop the flights that were pouring in with thousands and thousands, and actually over the course of a couple of years, hundreds of thousands of people flying over our borders. They didn't stop that. So they came from places all over the world into your cities and small towns changing them forever. And I have to say, ruining them. Ruining your cities and towns, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members, people from mental institutions, and insane asylums, human traffickers and women.
How about number five, the Afghanistan catastrophe, the most embarrassing event in the history of our country? [booing] She wouldn't do that again. You have to understand. She said, ""No, I'd leave it the way it is."" We're just going over just a small list. That was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Probably Putin went into Ukraine because of it. He looked and he saw the gross incompetence of this president that can't speak. The October 7th attack on Israel would never have happened. But she said that was fine too, because she didn't want to change. She actually said she didn't want to change anything. She'd leave it the way it is.
So I said, let's make a list of just some of the bad things. This is just a small list. October 7th, where you take a look at what happened. She doesn't want to change that, the slaughter of a lot of people. The Ukraine disaster, millions of dead people because of the weakness of this administration. Putin never would've gone into Ukraine if I were president. It would never, ever have happened. How about the natural gas export ban that is crushing Pennsylvania right now? Most of you don't even know about that. You hear fracking and all. By the way, if she ever won this thing, you wouldn't be fracking for 24 hours. But how about that? And it's crushing Pennsylvania, hurting you. It's going on. It's on right now.
Pushing, how about this, pushing transgender ideology on minor children? [booing] How about that one? Your child goes to school and they take your child. It was a he and comes back as she. [booing] And they do this. And they do it. And often without parental consent. Can you even believe we're saying this? How about, how about men playing in women's sports? How about that? [booing] She wouldn't change. How about the insane electric vehicle mandate where everybody's got to have an electric car almost immediately? [booing] They don't go far. They cost a lot more. And they're going to be made in China. And by the way, I think they're fantastic for a certain group of people that want them. And I'm not saying that because I'm a big fan of Elon, who endorsed us. You know that, he endorsed us. [cheers and applause] Elon's great and he makes a great product. And it is and there's a market for it. It's great. There are people that want it, and I think it's fantastic, actually. But you know what? Some people want gasoline. We have more gasoline. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country anywhere in the world.
But I'll tell you, Elon was at Butler. You saw him. He was having the time of his life. [cheers and applause] And I didn't even know we had it. He saw a black hat. You saw that. And it has in a very subtle way with black letters, ""Make America Great Again."" And I didn't even know we sold them and he wore one. And you know his imagination is rather good, like better maybe than anybody in the world. He sends up rockets. What he did with Starlink was so incredible for North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama. [cheers and applause] They said, ""Sir, do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""Yeah, I happen to."" He just endorsed us like the best endorsement you've ever heard. He said, ""We're going to save America. If we don't, this country is ruined.""
But think of it. They said, ""Do you know— Because he has something called Starlink and it's very hard to get. It's so popular."" I said, ""What do you need it for?"" He said, ""In North Carolina we have absolutely no communications."" Also, the Governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job. They didn't have any communications in certain sections of Georgia. And I said, ""Well, what do you want? He said, could you get us like Starlink?"" So I called up Elon. I said, ""Elon, what the hell is Starlink?"" [laughing] I said, ""Because North Carolina needs it for communication really badly, and it's very hard to get."" And we talk for about a minute, and all of a sudden I'm getting messages, ""Thank you."" From North Carolina, from Georgia. ""Thank you very much."" I'm still on the phone with him. I said, ""How the hell did you do that?"" He started sending it out and we hadn't finished our conversation.
So we're dealing on a different level with Elon. [cheers and applause] And it was great. It saved them. It saved them because all their wires were ripped down. And I asked the people, I said, ""So what's better? The wires all over the place when they were working or Starlink?"" He said, ""Honestly, Starlink is better."" He said, ""Starlink is better."" So we thank Elon because he helped a lot of people, probably saved a lot of lives. [cheers and applause] And we thank him for the endorsement, right? We thank him for the endorsement.
And I also want to tell you, he made that black hat so—We're selling. So what happened? I didn't even know we had it. It's selling like hotcakes, 10,000 hats were sold in like the last day and a half. But listen, more importantly, he calls it Dark MAGA. [cheers and applause] Dark MAGA. I said, ""That's the coolest name. That's the coolest name I've heard."" And he likes it. He's wearing it all the time now. He's great.
And one more, 11, the worst hurricane response since Katrina. And she's on a fundraising comedy tour while people are stranded and drowning all over some of our greatest states. [booing] So as the floodwaters rose in North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama, Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Kamala flew—By the way, do you think Biden could have done that? Do you think Kamala could have done it?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: No, Biden would've done better. I think Biden would've done better. I think he's smarter than Kamala. You know, he's been reinvigorated. He's looking good compared to Kamala. No, he has been, right?
Look, Mr. Wall, please stand up. Mr. Wall. [cheers and applause] This guy's a wealthy guy, he does great, but he likes the rallies. He's been to like 250. How about front row, Joe, stand up. Will you please? Thank you, guys. They got front row Joes all over the place. Unfortunately, most of them can't get a front row seat. It's one of those problems. Thank you very much for being. A lot of rallies, like 260 something rallies. And Uncle Sam, thank you very much, please. [cheers and applause] The great Uncle Sam. I got to shake his hand. I have no idea who the hell he is. I got to shake his hand two weeks ago. He has the strongest handshake. I'm saying, ""Man, that guy's strong."" Thank you, Uncle Sam. You're great.
Kamala flew to a fundraiser in San Francisco, a city she absolutely destroyed. She destroyed San Francisco. It was the best city in the country and now it's not good at all. Well, families desperately tried to escape the rising floodwaters, and they climbed onto roofs. They did anything they can to live, but Kamala didn't send any helicopters to rescue them. And when people sent helicopters, they turned them back. And by the way, when Elon sent Starlink originally, they confiscated it. They took it. It took them a long time to get it over there. And it's a disgrace. And he doesn't want to say that, but I'll say it. It was disgraceful what they did. So she didn't send anything or anyone at all. Days passed. No help as men, women and children drowned. North Carolina has eight military bases, great bases. Fort Bragg. Remember Fort Bragg? They changed the name. We won two wars, two World Wars, actually, to be specific from Fort Bragg. But they changed the name to, I'm not even going to say it. Let's just call it Fort Bragg.
I think—What do you think? Has nothing to do with Pennsylvania, but the people of North Carolina would like to leave it as Fort Bragg. Can we do that? Yes?
CROWD: Yes!
TRUMP: I think so. But they had rescue helicopters that could have easily be sent, and there was just no coordination. I'm not surprised because I've been dealing with them. There's nothing. But instead, Kamala recorded a podcast known for its graphic content. Can you believe it? She did nothing as people struggled and drowned and day after day, no one came and they still, it's totally deficient. Fortunately, the private sector kicked in and they're really helping and doing a good job, I will tell you. [cheers and applause] It took six days before Kamala and Joe sent a small number of troops to help. And despite all of this, Kamala Harris said she's not going to do anything differently. So if you had your chance, would you do something differently? ""No, no. I'd keep it just the same."" Think of the things I read, and that's a small portion of the incompetence. What they've done to our country is unthinkable. This November—This November, the people of Pennsylvania have to tell Kamala Harris that we've had enough of you. You're an incompetent person. You're the worst vice president in the history of our country, acknowledged to be. Kamala, you are fired. Get out of here. You are fired. [cheers and applause] Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out of here.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: So her answer that she would do nothing different is disqualifying. Kamala Harris is grossly incompetent, she cannot be trusted, and she is totally ill-equipped to do the job of President of the United States of America. She's ill-equipped. Frankly, Joe Biden is ill-equipped also, but at least he got 14 million votes, right? He's also ill-equipped, but what are you going to do? And let me tell you, he may hate her more than he hates me. That's possible, right? What do you think? Dan, do you think so? I don't know. I think so. I believe it's very interesting what's going on. You see the play now? They're fighting like cats and dogs, the two of them. I believe that he hates her perhaps more than he hates Trump. And I'm a little bit upset about that actually. Our country just went through four years of incompetence and we cannot handle four more years. We're not going to have four more years of it, nor will we have a woke military. We don't have a woke military. This is what we have. This is where we're going. Check it out.

TRUMP: Quite a difference. It's quite a difference, isn't it? We just have to have a little fun in these rather troubled times, don't we? Huh? But there's a lot of truth to that when you see it. We had tough stuff today. It's a little bit different. But I'll tell you what, I know the military well. We defeated ISIS in four weeks. [cheers and applause] It was supposed to take four or five years. We have a great military and they're not woke. Some of the stupid people up top are woke. But you could throw those military people into a woke room, scream at them for two years. They'd come out, they want to fight. Okay? They are great. We have a great military. I saw it because—
By the way, I'm the only president in 78 years that didn't start a war. But I finished wars. [cheers and applause] I finished wars. I finished wars. Remember when Crooked Hillary said, and she said, remember when Crooked Hillary said, ""Look at him. He's going to start a war."" I said, ""No, no, I'm going to stop wars. I'm going to stop them."" And I did. 78 years, 78 years. But I wiped out ISIS at very quick time. They said it was going to take four or five years. I did it in one month because our military is great. [cheers and applause] Our military is great. Just yesterday, it was reported that Kamala Harris brought in a totally unvetted refugee from Afghanistan, who has now been arrested for plotting an ISIS terror attack on the United States during our election. This is the people we've brought in. We've got thousands of them. This is one.
Kamala completely abandoned her duty to law-abiding Americans, and spent the last four years importing criminals, unvetted refugees, and terrorists into our country. As we speak, she has, and this was just announced last week, 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers roaming free in our country, murderers that they're released from penitentiaries, prisons and jails. [booing] You got 13,000 plus murderers in our country that were released from jails from all over the world. They come from the Congo, they come from all over the world, not just South America. They do come from South America too.
Do you know the crime rate like in Venezuela is way down because they've sent their criminals into the United States? In fact, I'll make you a deal, if we don't win, if this crazy incompetent person gets it next year, this same group is going to meet in Caracas of Venezuela because it'll be much safer than your particular state. That's where we are. We're going to get these people out. We're going to deport them so rapidly. We're going to get the criminals, the murderers. [cheers and applause] And essentially, I will liberate Pennsylvania and our entire nation from this mass migrant invasion of murderers and child predators and gang members, terrorists, drug dealers, and thugs.
What we have—what they have done to our country is unbelievable. We get up and we talk and we talk. And I noticed something. Somebody was telling me the other day—We do a lot of these beautiful rallies and it's so great. We never have an empty seat, never have. Look at it, we're 100,000 people in Butler, more. Never have an—But they said, ""As you go on, you get angrier and angrier."" It's true because I read this stuff with all of these people being allowed in to destroy our country and by the end of my speech, I'm actually a little bit angrier, in some cases a lot angrier because they're destroying our country.
We will not allow these people to invade us or to conquer us. Do you see what they're doing in Colorado? They're taking over apartment buildings. They're taking over real estate. They become real estate developers from Venezuela. They have equipment that our military doesn't have. Where the hell did they get that equipment? And the Governor of Colorado, who's a weak Democrat radical left, he's beside himself. He said, ""Oh, what do I do? What do I do?"" You get them the hell out of there, that's what you do. [cheers and applause] The Democrats brought them in.
And you know what? Little cities and towns all over the country are being invaded, but the ones that aren't, they're just as scared because they know it's going to happen. Because we have hundreds of thousands of these people, and there's so many of them are criminal. And you know what? If I were the head of, I want to name countries, but they're all friends of mine in one way or the other. I know most of them, almost all of them. But if I were doing that, I would've done it even faster than them. In Venezuela, in many countries, they're emptying their prisons into our country. I would've had—Because Venezuela has only gone about 50%, I would've had it down to 100%. Why wouldn't I? Do you know the money they save and the turmoil they save when they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them? And do you think anything's going to happen That's going to be good with those people? No, it's not good. It's not good. This is not the American dream.
I will save your communities. I will send home all of those who do not belong in our country. And I will keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. And Kamala is known as the taxing queen, the taxing queen. Her plan will raise taxes for typical American families by an estimated $3,000 a year. Take a look at this.
[start of video montage]
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER(S): Calling for a full repeal of President Trump's tax cuts—if Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.—Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
Americans will face a hike. The Tax Foundation finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER(S): Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word. Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee.
[booing]
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala's plan will raise family's taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now, she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approved this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Thank you. So I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country. And I gave you the largest regulation cut for your companies that hired so many people. We had the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Everybody was working whether they went to the best schools and colleges and got doctorates and all of the different, or whether they couldn't graduate from high school. Men, women, the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, [cheers and applause] every single group, not one was left behind. And the best ones in terms of proportionately were low-income people. They did the best. And by the way, you have an invasion of people into country, and not including got-aways, more than 21 million people. The got-aways that nobody has any idea how many there are. They're going to be attacking and they already are. The Black population jobs, the Hispanic population jobs, and they're attacking union jobs too. And they're all pouring in.
So when you see the border, it's not just the crime. Your jobs are being taken away too. And it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. Kamala will deliver a 1929-style depression. I will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation and the greatest economy in the history of the world, which is what we gave you before. [cheers and applause] We will pass large tax cuts for workers, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our great seniors. [cheers and applause] That's a big deal.
Do we have any restaurant workers? Do we have any people that work in restaurants? No tax on tips. Remember they tried copying me. They gave it up. They gave it up. You know why? They got killed when they said it. Like a month later? ""Oh, she's going—Uh, we're going to have no tax on tips."" So they toyed with people with their education, with debt, and they said, ""Oh, well, we're going to pay for your college education. We're going to pay."" Never got it done. They won't get anything done. They can't get anything done. They never got it done. To bring jobs, factories, and wealth racing back to Pennsylvania, we will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21 to 15, and I got it down to 21 from 39. [cheers and applause]
But, there is a but, but only for those who make their product in America. Made in America. [cheers and applause] One of the biggest guys, highly sophisticated guy, a wealthy guy on Wall Street called me up. He said, ""Who the hell gave you that idea?"" It's so simple, right? You're going to get that additional tax cut, but you have to have your product made in America. Isn't that great? They said, ""Who gave you?"" that's like the paperclip. Somebody came up with the idea of a paperclip many years ago and people saw it. They said, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" But we're going to give a tax cut. You make your product here, because that means jobs, it means a lot of things. It means a lot of great things. And we're going to stop Mexico and China and all these countries from hurting this country because they're hurting it. And they're killing the automobile industry. You're not going to have any cars manufactured here. If we win, this country will become the automobile manufacturing place. [cheers and applause] We will bring plants back at levels that haven't been seen for 50 years in this country.
Right now, the Chinese are building big factories, auto plants in Mexico. They think they're going to make cars and send them over to our border and put everybody in Detroit out of business, put everybody in South Carolina out of business. Not going to happen, because I'll put 100 or a 200% tariff. We don't want their cars. We want to make our cars here. And that includes in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And for those who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay a rather stiff tariff for the privilege of competing with our cherished companies that we're going to take care of. And for the privilege of stealing our jobs, our treasure and our wealth, they're going to do that, that's okay, but they're going to pay something for it and it's going to be substantial. And we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.
And let me tell you, for 30 years, for 25 years, China didn't pay 10 cents to this country. And when I was president, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions. [cheers and applause] Not 10 cents. They literally never, they went under the guise, we are a developing nation. Well, we're a developing nation too. We're like, our nation's gone like this. We got to get it back up, but we're going to get it back up fast. But American citizens will use all that money. We're going to pay off debt. We're going to reduce your interest rates, we are going to, by the way, two things. When I was president, the interest rate was 2%. Now it's 10%, but it's not really 10% because you can't get any money at 10%. The American Dream for young people is gone. They can't buy a house. You can't get any money.
So it's not 10%, it's 11, 12, 13, 14, 15%.
CROWD MEMBER: What the hell.
TRUMP: It was 2%. Five years ago we had 2% and now we have not 10, probably 14 or 15 before you get it. But that puts you out of business, tariffs against us. Remember this, one thing is going to happen, or another thing. Number one, they're going to drop all tariffs against us. We have countries that charge us 150 and 200%, and we charge them nothing. And I started it and it was good. We were making a fortune. And then these idiots came in and they changed it. But we're going back to it. It's a pro-American. It's America First policy if you don't mind, America First. [cheers and applause] We have America First. And I believe my pro-American trade policies are one of the major reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. Never happened, it never happened. [cheers and applause] Including 65% of Teamster members in the Great Commonwealth, by the way, never call it a state. That's a very bad, that's career-threatening. I had a politician who was a friend of mine. He walked in and he started talking about the state. I said, ""Oh, he's dead."" He was dead. You can't do that.
David would never do that, right? No, you can't do that. You got to be very careful. The only thing worse is when Biden would get up, remember? And he'd talk about, he's in Idaho and he'd say, ""It's great to be in Iowa."" They'd say, ""No, no."" But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ""It's great to be in Florida."" That's palm trees. And you could be Winston Churchill. He was a great orator, a great, great orator, one of the greats. And if you make that mistake, no matter how good you are, the speech is a total disaster. Do you agree? But we don't make mistakes like that. We need every one of those Teamsters to get out and vote. Do we have any of the Teamsters here? Do we have them here? Oh, look at that. Thank you fellas. Appreciate it. We appreciate it.
The migrants are coming after your jobs, but I don't think you're going to be worried. I think you're going to be, they'll be okay. I know, they're tough cookies. They're going to be all right. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. We appreciate it. Really. Because it's jobs. They may be union, they may be not union. It's jobs. We want to protect our jobs. I don't care which jobs, we're going to protect our jobs. We're not going to let these countries come in and steal our product, and steal our companies. And all we're left with is one thing. Unemployment, it's not happening, not going to happen. And it's a very simple thing to do. It's essentially what they do. But see, we can do it better, because we have now this country. But if this country keeps going along the way it's going, we're not going to have that advantage anymore.
So we're leading in every key national battleground, just about poll. We're just, as I was coming up here, Rasmussen, highly, highly respected. One of the most accurate. They have us up by two points nationally. But don't be fooled, if we're up by two, it's about like 10. You know why? Because people can't poll Trump. That's what happened with Crooked Hillary. They thought they were going to win because they say to the people, they call up, who are you voting for? A Trumper, like these guys. They love Trump. Who are you voting for? ""I'm voting for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Or I'm voting for Lying Kamala Harris."" I don't use the name Harris. When you use the name Harris, nobody. If I say, ""Yeah, I'm up against Harris.""
CROWD MEMBER: Who?
TRUMP: They say, ""Who the hell is Harris?"" No, nobody knows. You have to say Kamala. Look, all my political warriors over there, the insider advantage has just come out where we have nationally, three points. We have in Pennsylvania, a three-point lead, which probably means 10. [cheers and applause]
And a brand-new Quinnipiac Poll shows us leading in Michigan by four and in Wisconsin by two. It's all good, but you got to get out. We cannot sit back. And we've made a lot of progress over the last, she had that little honeymoon period before she started talking. Once she started talking, I didn't know was it that I did a good job or that she's just so bad? You know what? Who cares. I say, who cares? Pennsylvania also needs to defeat your disastrous radical Democrat Senator Bob Casey. [booing]
And we want to elect the next Senator from Pennsylvania, Dave, you know David McCormick, he's right here. David McCormick. [cheers and applause] And I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I know him for a long time. He went to the best schools. He did that. He got great marks. I think that means something. It does mean something. How did Biden do, by the way? How did Kamala do? Not too good. How did she do? Not too good. I will tell you right now, this guy was a great student. He was a great soldier. He was a great businessman. He's tough as hell. David, I know you just spoke. Just come here, say, like for two seconds because nobody wants to hear you right now. Just come up. But we got to get this guy in office. Come on. Give me a little bit.
DAVID MCCORMICK: Thank you Mr. President. All right. It all comes down to the Keystone State. Right here. Right here, Mr. President, we're going to put you back in the White House right here in the Keystone State. [cheers and applause] We're going to win a majority in the Senate right here in the Keystone State. [cheers and applause] And we're going to save America right here in the Keystone State. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. He's really good. And he will be such a great Senator. He'll be phenomenal. And, you know, I know Casey, I was in Washington for four years. I don't know if I ever even met Casey, but he's been there a long time. He's boring. Nobody knows who the hell he is. Think of it. And he doesn't fight for you. He just votes the way the Democrats tell him to vote. This guy will be a leader and he'll bring business back to your st—your Commonwealth. Ooh. That was a close one. He's going to bring business back to the Commonwealth like you won't believe, he's going to be a great Senator for a long time to come. And thank you very much for being here, David. Great job. [cheers and applause]
We're also joined as well by warriors, members of Congress, who are great friends of mine. They've become great friends. When you're in war, we're at like a war because we have an enemy on the outside. Maybe China, maybe. Honestly, if you have a smart president, they're always going to be fine. They're always going to be fine. Because they always need something and they're always going to be fine. I have great relationships with a lot of these countries that nobody else can talk to, like, as an example, Ukraine never ever would've happened. Israel never, ever would've happened. The October 7th would've never happened. You would've never had inflation. You wouldn't have had that disaster in Afghanistan, the most embarrassing moment in the country's life. But I became friendly with these people, and they are. They're warriors. You have great ones here. Some places don't have them as good. I must be honest with you. I refuse to say who, but here, you have great ones. Dan Meuser. Thank you, Dan. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Dan. Great job. Thank you for all the help. You did so many things, he helped us on, Right To Try. You know what Right To Try is? It's such an important thing. We saved so many lives. He helped us so much. Lloyd Smucker. Lloyd, thank you very much. Great job. [cheers and applause] Been my friend. John Joyce. [cheers and applause] John, thank you. You're fantastic people. And Kat Cammack from Florida, Kat, thank you. [cheers and applause] Whoa. Wow. That's good. That's very good. Thank you very much Kat. And you heard Vivek. [cheers and applause] How about Vivek? Great guy. We're going to bring him in. I don't want to tell him yet exactly. We're going to pick the right, because I don't like talking, first I like to win. We got to win. Somebody said, ""Oh, sir, who's going to be Secretary of State?"" I said, ""Do me a favor. Let's win first, okay?"" Vivek knows that, but he's going to be a part of something that's going to be really big. Thank you, Vivek. Great job. Thank you. [cheers and applause]
You know, he started off as a rookie, and he did very well. He did very well. He wiped out a lot of guys that have done this stuff for a long time, didn't he? Very well. It's great. Great to have you. Great family too. In four incredible years under the Trump Administration, we've achieved more than any administration in the history of our country actually. We passed record tax cuts and record regulation cuts. We achieved all-time, low unemployment rates, record low poverty rates. We had the lowest, think of it. We had the best in terms of poverty, the best numbers you've ever had, and rising wages for everyone. Wages that rose at a level never seen before. We ended the NAFTA disaster, canceled the TPP, which would've taken all of your business out of Pennsylvania, withdrew from the ridiculous Paris Climate Accord. [cheers and applause] I want to call it the Pennsylvania Climate Accord, not the Paris Climate. No, they were ripping us off. We had to pay a trillion dollars. Russia had to pay nothing. India had to pay nothing. China had to pay nothing. [booing]
We had to pay a trillion dollars. I said, ""So far the deal's not looking too good."" I tell you what, as a business guy, I went in and I looked at some of these deals. I said, ""Who the hell negotiated these deals?"" I said, ""Hanky-panky going on, I think."" Of course, Biden got a lot of money from China. They never say that, the fake news never talks about it. [booing] If that were me, if that were me, I'd be excoriated. Remember I said at the debate, I said, ""Let me ask you, how come the mayor of Moscow's wife paid this man three and a half million dollars?"" And Chris Wallace said, ""Please don't ask him that question."" Two weeks later, it became a hot subject. Don't ask him the question. And nobody really did ask him the question, right? I won the big case in Florida. He had a similar type of case, but the difference is, I have Presidential Records Act. My was 100% fine. I won it, I beat deranged Jack Smith. He's a deranged individual.
But Biden had a similar case, but he didn't have Presidential Records Act right? And Biden was essentially convicted. Think of this. Here was the decision. ""He's incompetent, so he doesn't have to stand trial."" So think of this. He's incompetent, so he doesn't have to stand trial, but he's allowed to be the President of the United States. Does that sound good? [booing]
I don't think so, but I'll be honest with you. I honestly believe that he's more competent than Kamala. I believe that. I believe he's more competent. And I thought he looked really good today because we were comparing the two of them. And who looked better? He looked sharper than she did. Can you believe this? But I stood up to China like nobody has ever stood up before, bringing in billions and billions and billions of dollars. And remember, I said it before, nobody ever brought in 10 cents. Not one other, not 10 cents. You check those records. We had the most secure border in U.S. history, fully rebuilt the United States military, and we created a new, beautiful, beautiful thing. I just love it. Wrapped up all perfect. It's called Space Force. Not since Air Force, 78 years before, Air Force, 78 years ago, we obliterated ISIS. And with the Abraham Accords, we made peace in the Middle East. We had the Abraham Accords. [cheers and applause]
If Obama even thought about an idea like that, he would've gotten a Nobel Prize. With me, I said, ""Don't waste your time. They're never giving it."" They don't give it, they don't give me anything. All we do is produce. We produce. I just want to produce for you. I don't care about them. And I'm proud to be the first president in decades who started no new wars. [cheers and applause] That's very good. But those four incredible years of peace and prosperity, and that's what we have. I shake hands with people. ""Sir, it was so good when you were president, and I'm not doing well now, sir, I'm not doing well."" They've been cut off with taxes and with regulations. It's horrible what they're doing. But they've been followed by four years of misery and failure under the worst president and vice president in American history. This is the worst president and vice president, this is the worst administration in the history of our country. The only one happy about it is Jimmy Carter, because Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter is considered, and his administration is considered brilliant by comparison. Would you say that's true Vivek, David, yes?
Now, Jimmy Carter had a brilliant administration by comparison. So he's quite happy. He's a pretty old guy. Just turning 100 or just about, right? He's 100 years old. And he's a nice man actually. He's a very nice man. But here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than Bernie Sanders. And even worse than Pocahontas. Do you know Pocahontas? Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. Remember? She said, ""I'm Indian."" Everyone said, ""Well, do you have any proof?"" ""No. My mother said that I had high cheekbones."" That's what she said. So I came up with the name Pocahontas, and it drove her crazy. And so she went out and got a blood test, right? Remember what the number was? 1,024th. Oh, this guy's good. 1,024th. That means essentially that I have more Indian blood in me than she has, and I have none unfortunately. [cheers and applause] I'd like to have some. I'd be honored to have some, but I have none.
She thought it was so good that she had 1,024th, it's like not even possible. It's not possible. And she was happy. She was so happy that she released a number. She thought it was good. And that was the end of her political career. She was leading in the presidential race back then. That was the Biden race. And you know where Kamala was? She had dropped out. She was dead last. She dropped out. She'd never made Iowa. And do I love Iowa. I love Iowa. I love corn. I love Iowa. Now, Iowa is great. We have a big lead in Iowa. Never lost in Iowa. Well, we had a great many years, what was it, 36 years. Nobody won Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And then Trump came along and we won Pennsylvania. And I'll tell you, there's more spirit now than I've ever seen. I'm talking about nationwide, because we have another factor. You like me, and you know that I'm a very competent person.
CROWD MEMBER: We love you.
TRUMP: But you know how, thank you. Thank you. I love you too.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. But now you see, but now you see how people can destroy our country. You know, the President has tremendous power. A president has tremendous power. And you can make or break a country. If you're stupid, if you don't know what you're doing, look at, the whole world is laughing at us. Five years ago, we were respected. Your president was respected, and our country was respected. And Victor Orban, one of the toughest leaders in the world, the strong people, the press hates him. They say, ""He's a tough leader."" Well, sometimes you need a tough leader, but highly intelligent guy, very strong person from Hungary. He's the head of Hungary.
And he made a statement. They said, ""Why is it that the whole world is going crazy?"" The whole world. Remember me? I had no wars. I had no anything. We had no terrorists. We had no terror attacks. Everybody was happy. We had no terrorist attacks. But he said, ""Why?"" They asked him, ""Why is it?"" They said, ""Because Trump's not president. If he becomes president, the whole world, because,"" and I don't use this word. I don't like the word for myself. I'm just saying the word. He said, ""The whole world was afraid of him. China was afraid. Russia was afraid. Everybody was afraid."" [cheers and applause] And I don't like that. I'd like to say respect, but I'm just saying what he said. So, because otherwise they'll say, ""Oh."" These guys are so bad. A big part of our problem in this country are those people right back there. [booing] Big part of our problem. We need a free and fair press. Badly, desperately. I watched the way they ask questions of Kamala yesterday. Howard Stern, he's a weak guy. He's weak. [booing]
He's going, ""Oh, oh, what about, oh."" It was so, even she was embarrassed. It was like softball, but all of them, Howard, I knew him very well. I was on his show many times. I used to think he was good. Then I dropped him, I dropped him like a dog. And his ratings are very challenged. Very challenged.
But I watched the questions. I watched that stupid View where you have these really dumb people. Whoopi Goldberg said, would you participate in a movie? She made some movie on basketball. This was before I ran for politics. She said, oh, you're so great. If you ever ran for president, you'd win. This is Whoopi Goldberg. You don't hear that. She said, I'm making a movie. Would you be in it? I said, in what capacity? Just a walk on. You're so great. Would you do it? I did a walk-on for Whoopi Goldberg. Now she says, I refuse to mention his name. You know what? Politics can do strange things to demented people. [cheers and applause]
Now, I've hired Whoopi to work for me as a comedian before this stuff, a long time ago. I went and I'm not particularly shy about what I hear. Her mouth was so foul. Every word out of her mouth was like the F-word that this. I was with a group of people, nice people, and we had to leave. She was so filthy, dirty, disgusting. Half the place left. I said I'd never hire her again, but she was so dirty. Every word was filthy dirty and I left. Then I see her sitting about, oh, Whoopi Whoopi. What a loser she is. [cheers and applause] But I watched the way they ask questions and it's like they're the same, like they are partners in this crime that's being committed.
Kamala, again, she was last in the primary. She was the first one to drop out of like 22 people and now I'm running against her. Now, I don't mind. I have a feeling that if they left Joe in by the time it's finished, because dropping like a rock now because she's actually forced to speak. Because she's behind, she's forced to go on and she's speaking and because she's speaking, people are realizing she's a dumb person and we can't have another dumb president. We've had enough. [cheers and applause] Can't have it. No, the country can't take it. I don't want to be nasty.
Somebody said to me, one of my people, a nice person. Staff person said, sir, please don't call her dumb. The women won't like it. The women want to see our country come back. They don't care. [cheers and applause] The women are tougher than the men, right? It's tough. I said, don't worry. I said, don't worry about the women. They'll be okay. They're going to be okay. You know what? They don't want millions of people coming through our border. They don't want militaries pushing us around. They don't want crime in the middle of our streets. They don't want hundreds of thousands of migrant criminals. Criminals. They don't want them walking down Madison Avenue in New York and Fifth Avenue and the shops being emptied. They want to see a country that works. We're going to have a country that works very, very soon and the women are going to like Trump. I think they like me anyway. I think it's all bullshit. [cheers and applause] They make it up. Thank you.
Kamala was an original creator of defund the police, okay? You know she was one of the originals, because she's a radical left person. Her father is a Marxist economist. I don't know what that means, a Marxist economist. But a Marxist economist. I'd love to meet the father. Where's the father? I want to meet the father. I might like him. I like Barack Hussein Obama's brother very much. He endorsed me. [cheers and applause] I like very much Tampon Tim's family. His family endorsed me. Tampon Tim, they endorsed me. The family of Tim, a terrible governor, the job he does is terrible. Anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being President of the United States. Okay? [cheers and applause]
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty for illegals, which will bankrupt Medicare and social security. These people coming in, I believe they do it for the votes. They really want to get them on the voting rolls. The amazing thing is a poll came out the other day with Hispanics. First time ever, Trump is leading. Look at her. Beautiful. [cheers and applause] Trump is leading. Never have. I think stupid Mitt Romney was at like 4% or something. How about him? How do you like having him as a partner? Mitt Romney, what a weak lad, we're getting him the hell out of here. But she wants to ban fracking. Her whole life, she talked about we will ban fracking, we will ban fossil fuels. Now all of a sudden, a little while ago, she said, that's not working too good. I love fracking very much. You know why? Because of your Commonwealth, she's now going around saying, I love fracking.
Let me tell you, this ever happened. Day one, there's no fracking and that's the end of Pennsylvania because it's the biggest factor in Pennsylvania. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing you. It's currently in effect, by the way, just in case you don't know. She lost more than 325,000. I'm just giving you the same numbers that I gave you before with her answer. And Attorney General—as Attorney General, she destroyed the state of California. As DA, she destroyed San Francisco. Now she wants to destroy the United States of America.
When she was the Attorney General of California, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as nonviolent crimes. She said, under no circumstances will they be prosecuted. [booing] She called them nonviolent crimes. They're pretty violent. Look, she's a liberal. She's a very liberal, she's not even liberal. Remember I used to say State of the Union, we will not be a socialist country. We will never ever be a socialist country. [cheers and applause] I was right. We're a communist country. They skip socialism now. I was right. They skip socialism. They to the next rung, communism. So I was right. We will never be a socialist country. Boom. They skipped it. So I was right. I like to be right.
She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. [booing] So I have the total endorsement of the NRA. How many people in here own a gun? [cheers and applause] All of my congressmen, they're not sure what they—Look at that. Dan, you know what to do. All of my congressmen, they're a little bit shy about that. But she will confiscate your guns, she's going to take your guns away. Just so you know. [booing] She sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on gas-powered automobiles. Congratulations. I'm sure you'll sell your automobile for a lot. That will be ended on day one. Okay, day one, boom. I will sign that on day one. I'm going to sign a lot of things. My hand will be very sore from signing. I'll walk out, I'll say, man, that's a lot of signing, and I've signed a lot of things.
She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. [booing] No. We are talking about major radical left stuff here. This is top of the line. It's true. Far left of Bernie Sanders. In fact, even Bernie Sanders said, you know what he said the other day? It's about time I put my foot down. We can't do this. He's complaining. Now Bernie is saying, I've got to put my foot down. This is too much. She is the worst. Perhaps most revealing of all, and it's the simplest of all, for the last three years, I heard how she slaved over the French fry oven at McDonald's. ""I worked so hard. It was so hot, the heat. I'd get burns. Oh look, it was a burn. I got a burn. I still have a scar. It was horrible."" Only one problem. She never worked at McDonald's. It was a lie.
In one way, I hate that. It's too simple. The fake news will say, oh, it's such a—But they refused to report it. They reported that she worked there, but when it turned out to be a fake, they didn't want to talk about it because they're fake. Hence, the term fake news. [booing] They're fake. No, they'll get [inaudible] because they've almost lost all credibility now. You can hardly read the papers. A lot of people like your accounts, your taxi drivers. You hear a lot of different things.
But you don't know, when we deal, when these guys deal and they go up and they give them a story and they know exactly what the story is and they give them the correct stuff and then they write it the exact opposite. A lot of people don't know that they are truly corrupt people. They are corrupt and they are the enemy of the people. [booing] They are the enemy of the people. We know than we know better than the others because we give them—Right John? We give them the information and then they write it the opposite and it's really disgusting. But here we are. We're leading for the presidency. So I don't know what the hell power they have. [cheers and applause]
Yesterday Tampon Tim said that they want to abolish the electoral college, take away all electoral power from the voters of Pennsylvania. They want to add in many cases they're talking about many, they're thinking about, first time I heard this number, 25, they want to have 25 supreme court justices. 'Cause it's the only way they're going to gain the power they think. No, they have to wait their turn. It could come back. It's the first time I've ever heard the number. It's got to be uneven. You know that right? Got to be. So I figured they'd stop at maybe 11, maybe 13. No, that's an unlucky number, so 15 maybe. Yesterday, first time I heard 25, they want 25. Tampon Tim and Kamala Harris are a true threat to democracy. I'm not the threat to democracy. By the way, if I was, I wouldn't have taken a bullet to the ear. I wouldn't have taken a bullet to the ear. [cheers and applause] They didn't.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: But with your vote this November, we are going to defeat these radical left country destroyers and we are going to finish what we so brilliantly started. We had the greatest economy in history. On day one, I will seal the border, stop the migrant invasion, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. We have no choice. [cheers and applause] The illegal migrants coming into our country are taking the jobs of American citizens, the black and Hispanic communities in particular. I will end inflation and we will make America affordable again. We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to get the energy cost way down. [cheers and applause]
I will fight for and protect social security and Medicare with no increases of age. How would you like to be—It's going to happen with them. Some nice guy worked hard, he's getting ready to reach that certain age and they announced you're going to have to wait an extra six years. No, it's not going to happen. Not with me. It didn't happen. Remember that? It didn't happen. It won't happen. Uncle Sam, I promise you. We will make America the dominant energy producer in the world by far, and we will frack, frack, frack and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause]
And I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, within 12 months of taking office. Get it down 50%. We'll do it because we have so much. We don't even use our energy. We will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate so you're allowed to drive to Washington without four stops, okay? I'd prefer not stopping four times. I will stop outsourcing and turn the US into a manufacturing superpower, especially with the car industry. They are going to love me in Michigan and maybe that's why I'm leading in Michigan. I'm leading by a lot in Michigan. I think the car workers—I think the auto workers are going to love me maybe more than anybody else because if I don't win, there will be no auto workers within three years. We won't make any cars.
Working with Elon Musk, we will slash a record amount of government waste and fraud and abuse. [cheers and applause] He's very good at that. I will end the war with Ukraine while I'm president elect. I won't even wait to get into office. I'll end it. [cheers and applause] Stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III, which is going to happen. World War III. We're closer to World War III than we have ever been. We've never been this close. This will be a war like no other because it's nuclear power. And this is not two army tanks, as I say, going back and forth and shooting at each other, Uncle Sam, right? This is levels of power and carnage and it's obliteration time. We can't let that happen and we won't have it. We will not have World War III.
These people don't even talk. I saw Biden hasn't spoken to Putin in, you know, like years or something. You got to end that war. That war is ridiculous. We got to end that war and I'll end it fast. I know both of them. I know Zelensky, I know Putin, we will get it ended. I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect that they so dearly deserve. [cheers and applause] We will strengthen and modernize our military. You know, I totally rebuilt our military and we gave $85 billion worth of it to the Taliban. [booing]
Did you see, there's another thing we were going to get out with dignity and strength, but you got to take out the military less. He took out the military first. Not smart. A five-year-old—Remember I had the five-year-old on stage. I gave him the stats. Would you do it first or last? ""Sure, I'd take out the military last."" ""Thank you. Go back to your mom."" Thank you. But Biden took it out first with Kamala's blessing. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA and a lot of it made in Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We're entitled to it. It's our technology. Why aren't we doing it all made right here? Jobs, jobs, jobs.
We will lead the world in space and reach Mars before the end of my term. I said to Elon, is that doable? Absolutely. He loves rockets, that guy, man. Never seen a guy that likes rockets so much. First time I got a glimpse, I said, who did that? Remember when the rocket engines came down? They have no wings, no nothing. I said, what the hell is that? I'm looking. It wasn't a missile; it was just a round tube. And it came down. It landed right on a barge, a circle. Four of them or three of them came right down, landed right on a circle from space. I said, who the hell did that? It was Elon Musk. I called him. I said, what's that all about? He said, well, engines are very, very expensive. So if we could save them and through certain this and that, we were able to do it. It's so incredible. They can use them again and again and again. How smart. How smart. And he said, we can do that. We'll be in Mars before the end of our term.
A lot of it also though does have to do with the military because we don't want to just send rockets up. The military, it's going to be a very important factor. Space Force is turning out to be a very big deal because a lot of the military is going to be surveillance, and everything will be having to do with space. We were being obliterated when I took office by China and by Russia in space. We are now leading by a lot. I put a guy in there who's done a phenomenal job, but Space Force has been a fantastic thing and a very important thing.
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington DC, which is so embarrassing. It's got graffiti all over the marble. It's got potholes all over the road. We're going to fix our capital and make it beautiful and we're going to be proud of it again. And our cities will be clean and safe and beautiful. We're not going to have crime. We're going to stop the crime. We're going to let the police do their job. I will support universal school choice, which is a big deal for people. [cheers and applause] We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school, [cheers and applause] and we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend the Second Amendment as I have done for four years, and it wasn't easy. [cheers and applause] Protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections like they have never been secured before. We want voter ID. Did you see in California, Gavin Newscum [sic]? Listen to this. He passed a bill, he signed a bill that nobody is even allowed to ask anybody for voter ID. If they ask, it's a criminal act or something. So there will be no voter ID. Now there's only one reason they want that, to cheat. But think of this.
He took it a step further. Gavin Newscum [sic], he has destroyed California. For me, it's hard to say these things because I have property in California. I have a lot of property in California and I hurt myself. But what I'm doing now is much more important than my properties. It's really much more important. [cheers and applause] Every time I say that, what a rotten job he's doing, I say, well, that's going to cost me a lot of money every time, but it doesn't matter to me. If it did, I wouldn't be doing this right now. Right? I wouldn't be doing.
But under our administration—And by the way, how good did JD Vance do the other night? [cheers and applause] Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris. Should be easy, should be very easy. And stop her radical left agenda once and for all, you have to get out and vote. We're going to make this a landslide. We want to make it a real referendum. We want to make it something where you go and you say, we have the right to stop crime in our cities. We want to make it big and we want to make it so that they can't cheat. If you win by a lot, they can't cheat. They can only cheat so much and they are cheatin' dogs. I will tell you that.
Early voting in Pennsylvania is underway. What the hell are you doing sitting here? Go. [laughing] So get everyone you know, thank you Uncle Sam. Look at that. He's the greatest. I love Uncle Sam. Look at him. Thank you Uncle Sam. [cheers and applause] He's the greatest, that guy. I don't know who the hell he is. He goes to a lot of rallies. Mr. Wall, do you know? I don't know, but he's great actually. So get everyone and go vote.
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country. I believe that. I also believe that if we don't do this, I don't think it'll ever happen. I think our country's going to be destroyed. They're destroying our country. You'll have 200 million people come in from all over the world, including prisons and mental institutions. With your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We love this nation. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. Together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause] We will make America healthy again. [cheers and applause] You know who is going to do that? RFK Jr. He's got some good ideas. [cheers and applause] We love RFK Jr, don't we, Vivek? Between the two of these guys. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. [cheers and applause] We will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania. Get out and vote. Thank you. Thank you, fellas.

    UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States, President Donald J. Trump!
[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Wow. Hello, everybody. This was supposed to be a little gathering in a plant. This was supposed to be just a little gathering. This is a lot of people outside, trying to get in. I want to thank everybody and I want to say here a very, very special hello to Scranton, and also to Pennsylvania. Can you all hear me? [cheers and applause] Turn this sucker up, please. Turn it up. Get this mic turned up, because I heard somebody say, ""Louder."" I've never had this. I've never heard that before. Turn it up. It's great to be back in the beautiful Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hard-working American patriots.
Just 27 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania, we are going to defeat Lying Kamala Harris. [cheers and applause] Lying Kamala, she's a liar. We're going to make America great again, right? [cheers and applause] And as you know, early voting is underway. So, when the polls open tomorrow, we're here, we're finally here. And you know we're way up in your—I want to say, look, let's do it this way. The main thing is to win. Let's say we're one point down. I don't want to tell you. We're actually up, but I want to say we're one point down. Everybody get to the polls, so we get these horrible politicians out of there. [cheers and applause] We want to get rid of them.
No, we're actually up in the polls in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Arizona just came out, we're up in Arizona, very substantially. We're way up in the polls, and the only place we're down, New York Times has a headline that we're down a little bit, but they're the only poll. Every poll, you got to see these polls, they're the best polls. New York Times, as we call it, the failing New York Times, it's fake news. These people are sick. [cheers and applause] Do you remember in 2016, they had to do an editorial, apologizing to their readers because they said, ""He's going to lose, he's going to lose, I swear he's going to lose."" And then I won, and they lost thousands and thousands of—I love that. It's going to happen again.
No, I came on today to the plane, and Susie and everybody says, ""Sir, you're up in this poll, you're up in this poll, you're up in this poll, you're up in every poll."" And then I picked up The New York Times, it said I'm losing by a whisker. They hope. They hope. No, they're fake news. You know they're all fake news, these people? They're totally crooked. They're so crooked. They're the enemy of the people. [cheers and applause] They are. They are the enemy of the people. So, get everyone you know and vote immediately, because that's the only one that counts, you know? November 5th, that's called our big poll. That's the real poll, right?
And they're going to cheat like hell and everything else. You know if they only cheat a lot, we're in great shape. But if they cheat in record-setting numbers, which they're capable of doing, I can't promise, but they are—they are cheaters. That's the way they do. When they have their first meetings—Our first meeting is, ""Where would be a good place to go? How about Scranton?"" You know what their first meeting is? Their first meeting is, ""How do we cheat? How do we cheat?"" That's all they—Because when you think about it, who can win with high taxes, open borders, allowing murderers to come in? You saw that last week, 13,099 murderers allowed to come in through them, over three and a half—13. Many of them have murdered more than one person. Is there anybody in the audience that's in that group, please? Because if they are, we want to get the hell out of here, or get him out of here.
If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing, it's very simple, we win. [cheers and applause] And your taxes will come down and your safety will go up. But we had an incredible evening here on Saturday, you probably heard about it. Maybe some did, maybe some didn't. I don't know. It was in a beautiful place called Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] And we were celebrating the brave firefighter Corey [Comperatore], who sacrificed his life in the attack, 12 weeks ago now already. And he really was, he jumped on top of his wife and daughters. He got hit. Man, he got hit. Two other gentlemen, two other—All Trumpers. To the nth degree, all Trumpers. But two others got hit too. They said they were dead, they weren't going to make it.
And the doctors, you have very good doctors in Pennsylvania, I tell you, they're doing well. They're doing well. ""How many?"" I said I was getting up. Before I even got up, I said, ""How many people were killed?"" Because it was wall-to-wall people. And I said, ""How many people were killed?"" They said, ""We think three, sir."" And I said, ""That's not good."" And yet I must tell you it was like this, and this maniac was firing bullets all over the place. I heard them go right over my head, too. But it was just terrible. But I said, ""How many?"" They said, ""Three."" And then the two went and they had unbelievable talent in the form of doctors, two separate doctors, and they saved their lives. But Corey, Corey was hit bad, he was hit hard. He was hit hard. But I thought what I'd do-
CROWD: Corey! Corey! Corey!
TRUMP: One thing, and I didn't want to say it the other night, it wouldn't have been appropriate, but one thing nice, that we raised a little money for Corey. And you know what it ended up being? For his family, for his family, it's beautiful. I think around $5 million, right? 5 million? [cheers and applause] And a friend of mine, a pretty wealthy guy, he said, ""Do you mind if I give a check to the family of Corey?"" I said, "" You can do that if you want. How much?"" He said, ""A million dollars."" And he handed me a check for a million. And then they raised another $4 million. And we also gave some, or we were going to give some to the two gentlemen that got badly hurt, they got badly hurt. But we raised four and a half, $5 million for the family. So, I think it's good. And that's out of love for what they do. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country, and we have to take care of our people, right? [cheers and applause] We have to take care of our people. You know it is true. And look at all that fake news back there. I say that all the time. [booing]
And if I'm a little bit off with a statement, they say, ""Donald Trump, he lied, he lied, it was terrible."" Now you have Lying Kamala, she lies about everything, including where she worked, remember? ""I worked so hard at McDonald's, it was unbelievable. I stood over the French fries all summer, winter, fall, spring."" She never worked there, she lied. You know the beauty of that? They'll say, ""Oh, it's so terrible to bring that up, it's so simple."" No, David, the beauty of that, it's so simple. It's so easy to understand. She said she worked like a dog in McDonald's and it never happened. She didn't work there. That's better than some complex, long story that I have to, before we get to the fact that she's a no-good liar. But you know what's more important about her? I don't like her. You know what's more important about her? She's just led the worst rescue operation in history in North Carolina. [booing]
The worst. And we have another big one coming in. But the worst, the one in North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Virginia, it was pieces of Florida got hit. It's incredible. The worst ever, they say. They had no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in, many of whom are killers. [booing]
Many of whom are drug dealers, many of whom are gang members, and many of whom came out of prisons from all over the world. You know they come out of prisons all over the world, and they drop them in our country? And do you know that the prison population, all over the world, is down because they put them in our country? They come from the Congo in Africa. Many prisoners from the Congo. Welcome, everybody, welcome, it's lovely to have you. They come from the Congo, they come from the Middle East, they come from Asia, they come from all over the world. They also come from South America, but not as many as you think. A lot. But everyone thinks they come from a few countries in South. No, they're coming from all over the world. They're dumping them in our country, because they think we have stupid people leading our country. And on that, I agree with them.
Sleepy Joe. Although Joe's looking pretty good lately. I tell you, he's looking pretty good, compared to Kamala, I say, right? It's first time. I said, ""You know, this guy's starting to look sharper. He's starting to look sharper."" Because we're comparing it—And he's angry at her and he hates her. The only question is, I think he hates her almost as much as he hates me. No, and I think he might be willing to—He can't take much more. It was an overthrow, okay? It was an overthrow. And he's having a hard time saying he did it voluntarily. He didn't. They pulled out—You know what they did, right? Article what? 25. That's what they did. And they said, ""You're sick. You're not gonna go on."" He got 14 million votes. He got 14, think of it. He got 14, she got none. And this was an overthrow. This is the first overthrow, or you could call it a coup. Do you want to call it a coup?
CROWD: Coup!
TRUMP: This was the first coup in the history of America. David, you're an expert on this stuff, right? Wouldn't you say? First coup in the history of America.
But look, I say to all Pennsylvania patriots, we have to—I just said, do me a favor, you got to see this, because we had over 100,000 people in a beautiful area, but not exactly highly populated. They came from all over, 100,000 people on Saturday night. Take a look.
[video clip of ""Make America Great Again"" rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on October 5, 2024]
CROWD: We love Trump! We love Trump! We love Trump!
TRUMP: That's something, huh? Isn't that something? We have some very big ones coming. We have some very big ones coming. We just rented Madison Square Garden. [cheers and applause] We're going to make a play. We're going to make a play for New York. Hasn't been done in a long time. It hasn't been done in many decades, but we're going to make—How could New York be run worse than it is, right? With all the problem, everything is corrupt in New York, and we're going to make a play. And let's see. I think that the migrants have taken over Madison Avenue, they've taken over Fifth Avenue, they've taken over the parks. The kids can't play Little League. You know it sounds like a trivial thing. It's a big deal, when you have a son that's a Little League player and he can't play. So, we're going to go Madison Square Garden.
We went to the Coliseum, Nassau Coliseum. We could have filled up the Nassau Coliseum three times, it was incredible. We left there a few weeks ago, it was incredible. So, we're doing Madison Square. We're going to go the arena in Atlanta, if we can get it. We're going to go the arena in New Jersey, if we can get it. You have to get it. But we're doing arenas because the crowds are so big. And we're making a play for New Jersey, we're making a play for Virginia, we're making a play for New York, New Mexico, Minnesota, where this lunatic comes from. I'm doing well in—You know why I'm doing well in Minnesota? Because he's running. It's supposed to be the opposite way, right?
If Kamala Harris gets four more years, she will annihilate the Pennsylvania energy industry, plunging communities across the commonwealth into darkness and despair. [booing] That's what's going to happen. Your jobs will be down and your salaries will follow. Congratulations, everybody. It's not going to let it happen. We're not going to let her destroy—You know she destroyed San Francisco? We're not going to let her destroy this country. She shouldn't be here, we shouldn't be—How would you like to be me? We spent $150 million destroying Biden, which wasn't that hard, actually, all you had to do is hold up his record. But we had the debate. And then after the debate, he was down so much and they went to him, and that's when they went to him. So, we get rid of him. This is like a fighter. A fighter is doing badly, he's losing badly. And Dana White says, ""You know what I'll do? I'll put in another fighter to fight. You got to take two people."" And so now they put this total Marxist communist person in there.
But people have figured it out. She had a very bad day yesterday, and we're going to talk about that. She had a bad day. She had a bad day. Kamala Harris was one of the original sponsors of the socialist Green New Scam, you know that? Where they want to spend $93 billion, 93. No, they want to spend, actually, she's spending $93 billion and a short—But they actually, their ultimate plan, is for $94 trillion to be spent. 94, listen to this. That's more than China and the rest of the world could spend if they really wanted to in 25 years. 94 trillion. We're going to clean the air, so that when China comes here and takes us over, they'll have a nice, clear atmosphere, because that's what they're doing. They're sacrificing our military and everything else. These people are crazy. She said repeatedly that she wants to ban fracking, her whole life. ""We will ban fracking. We will stop."" [booing]
I flew over some of those beautiful windmills. They're falling down, by the way. They're all over the place. They're all over the place. That gorgeous, beautiful Pennsylvania countryside. They got these big, ugly suckers hanging down. They're rusting and rotting. Half of them weren't spinning. And the ones that were were going so slow, they were going, it's not too windy, but they're going slow. The other ones were just dead, but they're all rusting and disgusting-looking. And then the environmentalists say—It's also, very importantly, the most expensive form of energy there is. You cannot get more expensive than wind. The wind, it sounds so wonderful. The wind! The wind. The wind is bullshit, I'll tell you, it's horrible. [cheers and applause] So expensive. Just too expensive, it doesn't work. All of that to do one-tenth of 1%. The whole thing is crazy. You remember when I used to say, ""Darling, I want to watch our president tonight on television."" And the husband looks, ""I'm sorry, dear. The windmills aren't wind. There's no wind tonight. You can't watch, darling, we're not going to be watching tonight. Maybe we'll catch him another time.""
No, we have to be careful. We have to be smart. We're going to lose our country. These people are crazy. They're crazy. They're damn crazy. We're not going to, we are not. We are going to get out, we're going to vote. We'll get it cleaned up. But if we don't clean it up now, it's going to be too late. I really believe it. We don't clean it up now, it's going to be too late. She sponsored a bill to impose a 100% ban on gasoline-powered cars and trucks. You know that, right? [booing]
One hundred percent. There's none. There's none. Even though we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation, by far. More than Saudi Arabia, more than Russia. Let's go electric. Let's do this. They want to go, now, hydrogen. They want a hydrogen car. You know what the problem is? When they blow up. You are unrecognizable. If this beautiful young woman is in the car, driving, and the hydrogen car, if it blows up, you are unrecognized. You with the nice Trump sign. Is that Trump? Stand up, let me see. Oh, I like her. I like her. [cheers and applause] I will not allow her to go into a hydrogen car. They don't blow up that often. They were saying, ""Yeah, but they don't blow up that often."" Oh, great. Thank you very much.
And as we speak, Kamala is crushing Pennsylvania with a natural gas export ban. You know about that, right? Designed to choke the life out of your fossil fuel industry. Listen to Kamala, in her own words, very recently.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris statements]: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all. If they fail to act, as president of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I am offering a Green New Deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive.
INTERVIEWER 1: He's going to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote.
HARRIS: Yeah, I will vote for it. It is a resolution. I believe that the underlying principles behind it are sound and important.
INTERVIEWER 2: What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?
HARRIS: Giving the workers an ability to transition into the jobs of the future.
INTERVIEWER 3: Can we afford it?
HARRIS: Of course we can afford it. It's not about a cost.
[booing]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris pushed the far left Green New Deal. That means huge new taxes, increased utility bills, and banning gas cars.
HARRIS: That's why I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.
JIMMY FALLON: Mamala Kamala just don't give a frack.
NARRATOR: Kamala's fracking ban would kill jobs and raise gas prices. Kamala doesn't give a frack about you. Only President Trump will bring back Trump's strong economy.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.
[end of video]
Thank you. So, when I'm president of the United States, and we did one great job. You know we did great in 2016, we actually did much better in 2020, but we're going to be very careful. We're not going to let that happen again. On day one, I will tell Pennsylvania energy workers to frack, frack, frack and drill, drill, drill. Drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] We're going to frack, frack, frack. We will have energy independence and energy dominance, as we did just four short years ago. We were energy independent four years ago, can you believe? Now we get our energy from Venezuela. What's that all about? From Venezuela, isn't that wonderful?
But if Kamala is re-elected, your course will go up and your lights will go out. That's what's going to happen. These stupid people. It's hard to believe. You know, you get angry because they just—Sometimes you get—And you want to be lighthearted, right? And we have a great audience, people that love the country, people that built the country. You've built the country and then you see these people, they want to destroy it. And by the end of your speech, you're furious. You're furious. Because all this stuff that we're saying, it's true. They want to destroy the country. Remember, she will never, ever let you frack. You're not going to frack. If she won, you're not going to frack. She's been against it her whole life. She just did this for an election.
Even now, Kamala's Green New Deal mandates regulations that are impossible, impossible to enforce. As an example, forcing power plants to shut down all across the country, more than 50 plants have recently been closed. So she took office and they are not going to be replaced. And you know, all you have to do with her is say all the things—""She's going to do this, she's going to do that."" Why the hell didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it? All of a sudden she likes walls. I built over 500 miles of wall. It kept us—We had the greatest border in history. Four years ago, we had the best border in our country's history. And that included human trafficking, mostly in women by the way. So when women say, ""Oh, I don't know if I like Trump,"" I was the one—That is the most heinous thing. Human trafficking, mostly in women. Gee, I wonder what that's all about, right?
And then they say, ""Oh, I don't know—"" Kamala's not going to protect anyone. They've allowed this country to be poisoned at our border. And a lot of people say—And this is not part of the deal, but I'd like to go off the teleprompter if you don't mind. [cheers and applause] I actually haven't—I don't think I've been on it yet. They're waiting for me. At some point, I'll be on it. But they're doing these things, nobody can understand it. It doesn't make sense, like men playing in women's sports, like open borders where criminals are allowed in. [booing] And literally by the time—I must be very good as a motivator because by the time I finish my speeches every time, I'm angry as hell because I can't believe what's happening to our country, what they're doing to our country.
Last year, Pennsylvania's largest coal-fired power plant shut down in Homer city, throwing hundreds and hundreds of workers out, just devastating. They got nothing. A small little community of 1800 people. Does anyone know where Homer is? Homer? Huh? Right? Stand up. Let me see you. Look at that. Are you a familiar—? Are you the man? I remember. That guy's become famous. Wow. Are you the guy right behind me? You're the guy that was looking—You're looking. You know the guy? Oh, I love this guy. What's your first name? What's your name? [cheers and applause]
This guy, he became more famous than me because—Okay, do we have time? Yes. To hell with these things, they're boring. Very boring. Now, this guy, he was the guy—No, I'm looking at him in the audience, I see him. But when the shots were fired, typically crowd control people, everyone flees. Now, in all fairness to the people sitting there, we had a tremendous, tremendous crowd that horrible day actually. Horrible day. But we had a tremendous crowd. He was behind me with a group of people, two, three times the size of this. It was bleachers, but 99% of the audience was out there. But this guy was standing up. So they say that when a shot is fired in a stadium like a soccer game, everyone—They call them stampede. They stampede, they get out, and a lot of people get killed. They get crushed, they get stepped on.
Nobody left, there with the big crowd or there but him. I mean, I don't want to say in particular because nobody left. Nobody left those stands. Normally—And there were a lot of shots being fired. There were eight shots being fired right over me. But what happened is we look back and it's such a famous thing now, and there's one guy that's standing. I didn't know you were going to be—And I didn't know he was going to be here. They gave you a good seat. They should give you a good seat. So listen to this. [cheers and applause]
Right. So this man, and he's back a few rows and next to a woman who was very brave too, and he's standing. He's not only not leaving, he's standing up and he's looking. He wants to find it because he knows—He saw a lot of blood all of a sudden, and he knew what happened, and all he cared about is, ""I want to get that guy."" But then our sniper took them out. And by the way, the local police too, they did a good job. Local police did a good job. [cheers and applause] But that guy, I said, ""There's a guy—"" ""David,"" I said, ""there's a guy I want in the foxhole."" We want him in the foxhole with me if we're ever in a foxhole because he stood up, he didn't care about the bullets. He was standing. All he wanted to do is find that guy. He said, ""There's a guy over there."" And you had some other people too. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. [cheers and applause] I love people like that. I love people like that. He's like a movie star. He has become a movie star, I'm telling you. We love him.
The head of the plant at Homer City said that Kamala's EPA had imposed a ""excessive economic and operational burden."" It wasn't possible to keep it open. It's being done on purpose. They're taking plants that are perfectly good, that are not polluting any more than anything else would, and they're closing them up and they're forcing you to use energy that's 10 times and 20 times more expensive and doesn't even work. One local businesswoman said that her life had been turned upside down by what happened, and a local union leader called the closure ""absolutely devastating and totally unnecessary."" And I hope whoever owns that plant can just keep it around for a few months, just keep going because we're going to let that plant go for a long time, okay?
So you got to tell them—Homer, Homer, you don't have long to go. I actually told the people in North Carolina who have been just devastated. I told them, I said, ""Look, just hang in for a few months."" It's tough to say. ""Hang in for a few months, but we take office on January 20th."" I said, ""Everything will be beautiful once I take office. Everything's going to—"" [cheers and applause] They spent all their funds. They have no funds to take care of—They have no funds. They have no workers. They have no nothing. FEMA, we had such a good FEMA. FEMA was great under Trump, that I can tell you. We had tremendous success. Under these demented and self-destructive Kamala Harris policies, Pennsylvania electricity prices are up 50% and are projected to rise by another 50% this year. So you're going to be up a hundred percent. Does anybody mind? No. You're making a contribution to the environment, right? Except you won't have any money left. You won't have a house left. You won't have a country left. You won't have a commonwealth left.
Even the grid operators themselves say that if the insanity continues, Kamala will crush the electrical grid of the United States of America. But we will not let her do it, will we? [cheers and applause] We're not going to let her do it. She's bad news. She doesn't even know where the hell she is. They ask her questions, she's like a vacuum, ""Huh? What?"" No, I don't want to be nice. Somebody said, ""You should be nicer. Women won't like it."" I said, ""I don't care."" They say that. [cheers and applause] A guy came up to me today. He said, ""Sir, you really should be nicer to her. The women won't like it."" The women want safety and the women want to have a country that they can be proud of, I think.
Anyway, so today I make Pennsylvania this promise. I will stop the energy price hikes, I will stop the plant closures immediately and we will restart the plants that Kamala has very cruelly closed. I mean, they don't know—They have thousands of jobs involved, people that have worked there for 25 years or longer, and we're not going to let it happen. I will terminate the Green New scam immediately. I want the cleanest water. You know, I don't know if you know, in my two last years we had the cleanest water we've ever had, we had the cleanest air we've ever had, and we had the most jobs and the most factories working that we've ever had. And the jobs they picked up were what are called bounce-back jobs. They were bounced back. They were the people that took off for the Covid, the gift—I call it the China virus because I want to be accurate and they bounced back.
I will end the destruction of our electrical grid. They're destroying our grid. It's already in bad shape, I'll tell you right now. But they are destroying—Isn't it amazing? We don't have any electricity, but they want to go all electric cars. Think of that. Now, think—I'm just thinking. We're talking about all electric and I love electric cars. You know why? Because I think Elon is great. [cheers and applause] But you know what? I like them for what the market is. There's a market—I think they're great. I think it's incredible. But the long distances and certain—And they're more expensive to make and a lot of them are going to be made in China. But you know the amazing thing about Elon Musk? He went to that rally. I think he had the greatest time he's ever had. Did you see it? He was jumping around. He was so happy.
He's always like—I envision him. He's sort of a reclusive kind of a guy. He's incredible. He's a total genius. We have to take care of our geniuses. But he comes up and he's looking at this crowd. He's never seen anything like it. And he started doing jumping jacks and stuff. No, he was just happy. I said, ""What's he doing back there?"" I would just give him a quick introduction. He had a great time and he got a black hat. I didn't even know we made black hats and it said, ""Make America Great Again."" But it was very low, very sort of understated, but a black hat. He loves that hat. And he called it Dark MAGA. [cheers and applause] Who thinks of this, Dark MAGA? And I called him, I told him, ""Thank you very much. We sold like 10,000 hats in the last two days."" I didn't even know we made that hat, now I find out it's like the hottest thing going, Dark MAGA. No, he's fantastic and he's going to do a lot. He's going to be involved.
He's great and he's going to be involved because we have so much fat in this country. We have so much waste and fat and fraud. But he's also—I will tell you—The funny thing with Elon, he never—With all I talk about electric cars and I'm totally for electric cars—Whatever the buyer wants to buy, that's good. But you can't force them down people's throats, you can't do that. Like the mandate. We're not doing mandates. So you can't do that. So just so you understand. So he never wants—And he's a friend of mine, he's great. He endorsed me. He endorses me so much, we have to get him—""We're going to lose our country if Trump—"" He's in Pennsylvania now campaigning, Elon Musk, because he feels so strongly. [cheers and applause] But you know the amazing thing?
A big company is Tesla. It makes great cars, really amazing cars. He never once said, ""Could you ease up on the electric thing?"" You would think he would've said, ""Hey, listen, do me a favor, could you?"" I could take it out pretty easily, right? It's a sentence. It's a sentence of the speech, but he never asked me to because I think he knows I'm right. He's going to do great. And there's people that like him. I like him too for certain applications, but he never thinks of it. And he's close to me. He never said, ""Do me one favor, just sort of lowkey—"" If I were him, I'd be saying, ""Hey, listen, Trump, do me a favor. Don't mention electric cars again, that you're going to do away—"" And we're not doing away. We're going to have whatever the market wants. We're going to have gasoline power. We're going to have hybrids. The hybrids are great. They're working good. We're going to have everything. We will make Pennsylvania an energy supplier to the entire world and I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, five-oh, within 12 months of taking office. [cheers and applause]
Your prices will be cut in half. Now, she, on the other hand, if her mandate—You look, number one, you won't have any energy because they can't produce enough. No matter what they do, they can't produce under what she wants to do. But even if they did, your prices are going to be double, triple, quadruple. You're not going to be able to afford—I say we have more liquid gold than any country in the world. It's going to be so quick and so easy to do. We have more than Saudi Arabia. We have more than any country in the world, and we're going to take advantage of it if that's okay, and it's pure, sweet, beautiful stuff. But for that to happen, the people of Pennsylvania have to tell Kamala Harris that, ""We've had enough. We think you're a horrible person. We think you're a liar. And we hate—"" Right? ""We think you're a liar. We think you're not a smart person. And we're tired of having stupid people run our country."" [cheers and applause] And we're going to say, ""Kamala, you are fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. Get the hell out.""
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Despite all of the devastation she's caused your Commonwealth, and she said yesterday she has no regrets. Did you see that? You'll see it in just about two seconds. Go ahead, put it on.
[start of video]
ANA NAVARRO: Well, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
KAMALA HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of—And I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.
[end of video]
[booing]
TRUMP: I think the other one asking the question is dumber than Kamala. So that's—She's a dummy. I watched her over the years. That is one dumb woman. Sorry. I'm sorry, women. She's a dummy. The only one that agrees with that more than me are the women in the audience. [cheers and applause] So think of this, what she said. ""No, I can't think of anything."" Did you see she froze? Did you see where her teleprompter went out? Her teleprompter went out and she said—It was 32 days or something before the election. So she said, ""Uh, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32."" She was freaked out. Thank God that sucker went back on—That would've been—I don't know what—She would've jumped off the stage. Now when you do this stuff, I would say probably 15, about 15% of the time, the teleprompters, they go out and either you—Can you imagine it goes out for Joe Biden? [laughing]
He's no good with the teleprompter blazing, right? No, it is gone out with him a couple of—You know what he does? He stops, looks around, and he walks off, but he can never find the stairs so it's a problem. He's looking around for stairs. Has anyone seen a stairway? We have more stairs than these platforms. I don't know what the hell it is. There must be a fire problem. There's like six stairs, and do you ever notice he can never find his way off the platform? Secret Service does a great job in that respect. They come up, they get him, they walk him off, but he looks better. I'm telling you. As I said, he looks better now than I've ever seen him looking. He's angry. He's angry at her. There's going to be an explosion before the election with them. Those two—There's going to be an explosion.
Did you see he held a news conference right in the middle of her one big event that she's had in about two weeks? He got up and held a news conference. He walked into the room—Nobody ever does it. He walked into the room and, ""This is a news conference, oh,"" and then he just died after that but it didn't matter. Can you believe that our country is being run by these people? Can you believe it? So she said she had no regrets. Everything great. She'd do the same thing as this guy, right? This really sad, pathetic guy. So after the surrender of our energy independence, the Afghanistan, horrible, most embarrassing moment in history, we lost 13 soldiers, great soldiers. We left billions and billions of dollars behind. We left Americans behind. You have Americans right now in Afghanistan, and they cannot be happy, right? They're probably—Many are probably dead.
The border invasion. The border invasion. How about the 13,099 illegal aliens convicted of murder? They're roaming free. That's okay. In other words, these are all things that are okay. These are all things that are okay. How about—? To me, the worst of all—Because it's not even imaginable. She's lost during her three and a half years 325,000 migrant children. They're gone. Nobody knows where they are. Many are dead. I would say most are dead. We don't know. We probably won't find out, but many are dead. Most are dead. Many are in sex slavery. Many are in slavery, but there are many dead. 325,000 young kids. Think of it. You could fill up Yankee Stadium many, many times. Think of that, many, many times. 325,000, they're gone. And the parents want them back. Nobody even talks about it. The fake news doesn't talk about. In terms of humanity, this is bigger than anything you can even imagine, right? This is the biggest thing. And she thinks it's okay because she said, ""No, I don't think I'd change anything."" All of this stuff would've stopped. The worst inflation in the history of our country costing everybody a minimum of $29,000 per family—Price hikes that cost a typical family—Think of that. No, she wouldn't change. $29,000, people don't have that money. The inflation has really destroyed the middle class. The elderly and people on fixed incomes are decimated. See, just think of it. Our middle class—How about Ukraine? If I were president, that never would've been a war. You wouldn't even know what Ukraine is. [cheers and applause] There would've never been a war. Putin wouldn't have done it. Putin wouldn't have done it, and that was okay with her. You remember what she said? She said, ""No—"" She didn't know where the hell she was.
She said, ""No, no, no, I'm fine. No, I wouldn't undone nothing."" How about the October 7th attack on Israel? [booing] That would've never happened. How about the fact that the United States is a laughing stock all over the world? How about she failed on the witch hunts against her political opponent, me? The first time that they've ever done that. They do it in other countries, like in Third World Banana Republics, the witch hunts. I call it the witch hunts against Trump. The one in Florida was thrown out, and yet Biden's document case, they ruled on him. They said he's guilty, right? Oh, he had documents for 50 years. He shouldn't, and I had—The Presidential Records Act. I was totally allowed to do it. Anyway, my case was won. He lost his case. What they said is that he's incompetent essentially.
They said he's got no memory and all sorts of other things, and therefore we shouldn't send him to court. They said he wasn't fit to stand trial, but he's allowed to be the President of the United States, okay? [booing] No, no. Think of that. Here's the ruling. He's not fit. He's got no memory and he's in trouble.
TRUMP: But he can run the presidency, but he cannot stand trial. They released him on the basis of that. The trillions of wasted dollars on the Green New Scam, all that money is not only wasted, it set us way back. Way, way back.
And the worst hurricane response since Katrina. She doesn't want to have a do-over with what's happened to North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, all the states that we just mentioned. Kamala Harris could not think of one thing that she would do differently. And you know, it's strange because when I saw that question, I said, ""Oh, this is going to be a long answer."" Because she could have done it in a nice way, ""I wish I would've done this on the border. I wish we would've closed up the border. I wish we didn't have the horrific acts of violence against all of those children."" And all of the things—And she could have really done—
And I said, ""Well, this will be a good answer."" She didn't know what the hell to say. But think of it, it was a soft ball question. And she said, ""No, I would've done everything—"" So, all of the agony, all of the suffering, all of the inflation and the border and the criminals coming into our country, she wouldn't have done anything different than this guy that should have really never been president, in my opinion, should have never been president.
So, she said that there'd be nothing. And to me, that is a disqualifying answer. That should disqualify her from even running. If that's going to be the case, she should be disqualified from even running. [cheers and applause] She's an incompetent person. She's grossly incompetent. She cannot be trusted. And she is totally ill-equipped to do the job of being president of the United States.
Let me tell you, I know all of them. I know President Xi, I know Putin, I know Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Biden, he said, ""Oh, that's a tough situation in North Korea."" We had no problem. I got along with him very good. A little rough start, right? Remember, little rocket man? Remember when he said, ""I have a red button on my desk""? That was a very threatening sound, ""I have a red button on my desk."" I said, ""I have a red button on mine too, but mine's much bigger and mine works."" [cheers and applause]
And then he called me and he asked for a meeting and we had a meeting. First time anyone's ever met—I said to Barack Hussein Obama—Has anyone ever heard of Barack Obama? Barack? Remember Rush Limbaugh? He used to go, ""Barack Hussein Obama. Barack Hussein Obama."" No. No. He told me that the toughest thing when we sit before—It's a beautiful thing, actually. The president sits with the new president coming in. He said, ""The biggest problem we have by far is North Korea."" We didn't have a problem with North Korea. Believe me. You may have in the future if you have stupid people running our country. But we had no problem. I met with him. It was a big deal that I met with him a second time. We were on our way to doing something fine. But he's got tremendous nuclear power. Somebody let him get there.
Our country just went through four years of really a horror show, and we cannot have four more years. We just had a man who's grossly incompetent as our president. And now we have a woman who is actually, in my opinion, worse than him. I believe she's worse than him. And we can't allow it to happen. Now, I had this done because our military is great. I knocked out ISIS. I knocked out ISIS. I knocked out ISIS. They said it would take four to five years. I did it in about a month, right? And we knocked them out.
General Raisin Kane, this is a tough guy. Our military is great, and they're not going woke. You could put them in a woke room and scream at them for two-and-a-half years, they'd walk out and they'd say, ""Let me at them."" These are not woke people. But I had this little clip and I thought you'd find it very interesting. It's the military of the past, let's call it the Trump military, compared to the very woke military that we have now. I think you'll get a kick out of it.

TRUMP: So, it's a little exaggeration, probably really not that much actually, but what's happening to our country is—We have to preserve our country. Pennsylvania cannot let this woman become the president of the United States. She's the taxing queen. She's going to raise your taxes where you're going to be at least paying at least $3,000 a year more. Take a look.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. And on day one I will repeal that tax bill.
Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut.
Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
MEGHAN MCCAIN: . . . everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed. And also looking at estate tax are going to have to go up.
We will tax capital gains.
But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
UNNAMED COMMENTATOR 1: It's just a new way of looking at things to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
COMMENTATOR 2: I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
COMMENTATOR 3: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
COMMENTATOR 4: I think that this reaction to unrealized gains is a little funny given that I bet that the majority of people watching right now are already paying a tax on unrealized gains. It's called a property tax.
[crosstalk among commentators] Property tax.
When the value of your home goes up.
Property tax is a use tax. It's a use tax.
That's an old-
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes. Even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves.
Not the same.
The way something else moves that you don't-
It's always the go-to answer.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors. And there has to be—in that, we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, in particular, a carbon fee.
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Yeah, we're going to cut your taxes. I've been involved in politics not that long on this side, but I've been involved. I've never seen anybody campaign on, ""We're going to raise your taxes."" That's what they're doing. The world has gone crazy. This guy. But David, we're going to cut taxes. Do you agree? David. David is going to win. [cheers and applause] You got to get him. You got to get him. I want him to come with me please. He's great. He'll be one of the best. A real hero.
Kamala will deliver a 1929 style depression, not recession. I will deliver lower taxes, lower regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, low inflation and the greatest economy in the history of the world, which we had four years ago. We had that. We were going up—Nobody's ever seen anything like what we had. I was shaking hands with people. I said, ""How are you doing?"" ""We did great four years ago, five years ago. My company, I made all my money. And now we're not doing good."" Everybody said, ""We're not doing well. The taxes are too high. The interest rates, we can't borrow money at 10%."" They were at 2% with me. Now they're at 10%, but they're not really, because you can't get money at 10%. So, that means they're higher. 12. How about 13? How about 15? So, it means it's much higher. It's not 10%. You can't get the money. Nobody can get the money at 10%.
We will pass tax cuts for workers like you haven't seen before. And we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great, great, great, great seniors. [cheers and applause] Right? No tax. Take a look at this comparison chart. There's nothing like a chart. It's actually not my favorite chart. I have another one that's much more of a favorite, but that's okay.
You see that? Look, it's ridiculous, the whole thing is. We shouldn't even have to campaign. This should be an automatic—To bring jobs back and factories back and wealth. All we want to do, we want to bring wealth back to Pennsylvania. We want to bring wealth back to our country. We will have a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. You know, I took it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said it couldn't be done.
By the way, Steve Moore was a great guy. Do you know who Steve Moore is? Great economist. He wrote a book The Trump Miracle. And the book is number one book, just one out. You know whose book is also number one? Melania. [cheers and applause] Her book is number one. Her book is number one. I got a call today. You know who called me? Bill O'Reilly. He called me. Bill O'Reilly. Do you know Bill O'Reilly? I like Bill O' Reilly. A good man. He's a good man. And he went through it. But he's very good and he's very good with books. He said, ""Yeah, Melania replaced me as number one on the list."" I said, ""That's the way to go."" But no, she did a great book. Yeah, go out and get that book. That's a good one. That's a good one. I think she treated me well, otherwise I wouldn't be talking about it, right? I would stay so far—I said, ""Do me a favor—"" I just wouldn't mention it, but now I do.
Cutting the tax from 21% to 15. So, we got it down to 21 and then I said, ""You know what? 21 makes us pretty competitive with the world."" Just so you know, our companies all trying to be stolen, and a lot of companies are lower than 21. So, I want to bring it lower. And I wanted to, originally—I got it down to 21. Everyone said that was impossible. Got it approved by Congress. But now I want to get it down to 15, but only for those companies that make their product in America. Isn't that a good idea? You make your product in America. In other words, you're creating jobs. [cheers and applause]
Think of that. Vivek, is that good? How about that? I got calls from very smart people like Vivek and they said, ""Where the hell did you ever come up with that idea?"" How simple is it? Your tax is going to go down from 21% all the way down to 15, which makes us just about the most competitive—I think there's very few—I mean, no great nation, no big nation—We get it all the way down. But you have to make your product here.
And I got a call from Wall Street geniuses, ""Who the hell gave you that idea? That's a great idea."" These guys, that's all they do is they think. Nobody ever thought about that. We're taking it down from 21 to 15. And then we have to do something very important. Those who don't make their product in America, and there are those that come in, like China and various others, they will be forced to pay stiff tariffs to—And remember this. This is a privilege. William McKinley. This is a privilege because it's a privilege of competing with our cherished companies.
So, we have companies, we have to protect them, and it's a privilege of stealing our jobs, our treasure, and our wealth. They're going to come in and they're going to have products, and they're stealing from us because they're taking our jobs, they're taking our companies, they're taking our wealth. And that's fine because they have to compete too. But now they're going to have to pay for it, and they'll have to pay and they'll pay hundreds of billions of dollars in pretty stiff tariffs. But what we're doing is we're preserving our companies, but we're doing something more important. They don't have to pay either, because all they have to do is build their plant in the United States of America and hire many of the people in this room. [cheers and applause] It's very simple. Right? David, are you on board? He's on board. Thank goodness. Thank goodness. If he said no, I don't know if I could have been so enthusiastic about you. No, it'll make us a rich country again. Right now we owe $35 trillion because of stupid stuff like this. And other countries, China in particular, they've done this for years and years and years. They built their country with money that we paid them. We're paying them $500 billion on average a year, for years. They built their military with our money.
So this will—We want them to do well. I want them to do well. I made a great deal with them. They have to buy $50 billion a year of product. I thought they said 50. ""My guys, I said, ""what's the number you want? 15?"" I said, ""15. Oh, good."" But I thought they said 50. So, they came to me and the deal was almost finished and it said 15. I said, ""What do you mean 15? You said 50."" They said, ""No, sir, we said 15."" I said, ""You didn't say—Make it 50. Go back to them, say, 'We made a mistake.'"" They went back and China accepted it. Can you believe it?
But I don't even talk about it because of COVID. I don't even mention it. We have USMCA. We did the deals with Japan, with South Korea. We were screwed by everybody, friend and foe. And the friends did a worse job on us than the enemies. The enemies were gentler to us than many of our friends on trade. But Japan, we redid that deal. We redid South Korea. We redid did a lot of deals. And we were respected.
You know, five years ago, we were a very respected country. And I don't want to say this too loudly because it could happen, but I don't fall down stairs. I don't fall on platforms. I don't fall off bicycles. [cheers and applause] I have a great memory. I can talk about hundreds of things at one time and always get back to that point that you were trying to make. I can do things that people can't do. But you know what? This is the most important period in the history of our country because our country, this is a nation in decline. We are a nation in decline. We're a failing nation. We're failing nation. And they have no clue what to do.
She wants to raise everybody's taxes. And what they do, today—They used to go to different states. If Pennsylvania was high, they'd go to another state, but now they go to different countries. Other countries want our business, they want our companies. And a lot of them have left. The pharmaceutical business left. A lot of industries have left. We're keeping them. And we're going to get all those people back. We're going to make it so they practically have to come back.
So, we'll take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we're going to make our country so strong and so rich, it will never be so rich. [cheers and applause] We used to be an all-tariff country in the 1890s, 1880s, 1890s, early-1900s, all tariffs. That was when our country was the richest it ever was. It was never rich like that. It was so rich that they had to set up a commission, the great Tariff Commission of like 1887. It had one function, what to do with all the—We had so much money, we didn't know what to do with it. And then, in the 1900s, they brilliantly went to the income tax where everybody gets taxed and foreign companies could come in and just steal our treasure and our jobs, steal our wealth. And honestly, we've never really been the same.
The country made so much money and other countries lived. They were fine. But we're like taking care of the whole world and it's time for the world to take care of us. [cheers and applause] Does that make sense? Time to take care of us. And we're going to pay off debt, or we're going to reduce taxes still further because that's what it's all about. We gave you the tax cut and it was the biggest tax cut in American history. We gave you that tax cut. And our revenues were greater with a much smaller number. You paid much less. And yet, as a country, we did much more business. We had great years.
My pro-American trade policies are one of the major reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters Union. [cheers and applause] Including, oh, 65%, I got a 65% number from the Teamsters of Pennsylvania. Is anybody here from the Teamsters? I mean, where are they? I love them. Where are you? I heard that—Look at these guys. That's great. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] That's great. That's great. Thank you.
Now, we got the firefighters endorse us. [cheers and applause] You probably heard they haven't—Oh. Wow. Look at that. That's a very good-looking group of human beings, I will say. That's a healthy-looking group.
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: That's nice. That's nice. Thank you very much. Wow. I didn't know you'd be here. So, the firefighters, I guess, they haven't—Every year for what? 60, 70, some crazy number of years, they always automatically do the Democrats. And the rank-and-file said, ""We're not doing that."" And they voted overwhelmingly for me. And the union heads always have a problem with that. They always have a problem. [cheers and applause]
And the same thing happened with the Teamsters. And that's happening also with the auto industry because United Auto Workers, you're not going to have any jobs unless they vote. And if they vote for me, we'll have more autos being made in this country than at any time since the heyday, which was about 60 years ago, because all it is, is a one-way street out of our country. We're going to rebuild the auto industry in our country. We're going to make it so good and so powerful and so great again. [cheers and applause]
So, firefighters, thank you very much. We love you guys. That's good. Teamsters, thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Great people. No, that's great. See, they don't go necessarily by the heads. The heads. Although, I have to say the head of the Teamsters is a terrific guy, tough guy, good. He was fine with it. He was okay. He wants to go with what the people want. Sean O'Brien, he's a great, great guy. And I don't know as well, the firefighters, but as far as I'm concerned, he's a great guy. Has to be good. I like people that like me, don't we? I like people—If they like me, I like them. So, we're pleased. Thank you, fellas, very much. That's great. Any fires lately? Have you put out any fires lately? Any big bad ones? Huh? You guys have a lot of guts doing what you do, let me tell you.
We're pleased to be joined today by your next senator, Dave McCormick, and everybody is really, really impressed with Dave. [cheers and applause] I know him for a long time. Everything was the best. He was the best student. He went to the best schools. He went out in business, became one of the most successful guys, ran one of the biggest funds, and very successfully. I don't know. You sure you want to do this? I think I've talked a lot of people out of it. They see what I go through, you know? I had more investigations than Al Capone. He killed a person a week. Alphonse Capone, the meanest Scarface, the meanest of them all. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone ever even dreamed about. Of course, he used to kill the investigators. I don't do that. Do you want to come up for one second, David? Fast. Come on. Come on, David. Come on.
DAVID MCCORMICK: It's good to be here. Thank you. All right, well, thank you. Great to be in Scranton with the next President of the United States. [cheers and applause] President Trump, we're so honored to have you here, and we are committed in Pennsylvania to putting you back in the White House and changing the majority of the Senate and sending Bob Casey packing, so thank you for being here. What happens in Pennsylvania is going to—What happens for the country depends on what happens in the next 27 days. As you know, Mr. President, I was a wrestler, lots of wrestlers here in this part of Pennsylvania. And I wasn't the best wrestler, but I always knew in college, if I could get into the third period within a point or two, I would win. Because the third period is not about wrestling. It's about mental toughness. It's about heart. It's about staying on offense. It's about fight, fight, fight. Thank you, Mr. President.
TRUMP: Thank you, David. Callista? Are you Callista?
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: We have somebody else that I think is amazing. I had to compete with this guy and I thought it was going to be easy, but it wasn't. He was nasty. He was quick. He's smart as hell, and he knew things that a lot of people didn't know and didn't understand. He did amazingly well, because he started really as a rookie, and he got up and he wiped a lot of very smart politicians off the stage. [cheers and applause] And then one day he came up to me, he goes, ""You know? I don't think I'm going to beat you."" I said, ""You're not going to beat me. You're not going to beat me."" He's a great guy. He's really smart and I hope he's going to be involved in our administration. I do hope that. [cheers and applause] Because we can put him in charge of one of these big monsters and he'll do a better job than anybody you can think of. So, Vivek, please, thank you very much. Vivek is great guy. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. No, he's tough. Tough and he's smart. Before I go to a couple of great, really, warriors, I want to introduce in a way another warrior, Callista. Callista, will you please stand up? Callista? Oh, you can stand up anyway. No, I'm only kidding. I know. I know you are, and I know. Thank you very much, thought, I appreciate it. Thank you very much, darling. Appreciate it. You look great. Thank you.
Congressional candidate, Rob Bresnahan. [cheers and applause] Rob, thank you. How's that going, Rob? Good. Thank you very much. County Commissioner, Chris Chermak, and Mayor. Thank you very much, Chris. Good job you're doing. Mayor Carl Curran. Thank you. Where's Carl? Thank you. He's here. I shook his hand a little while ago.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Huh? Oh, oh. Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you very much, Mayor. I also want to send our love to everyone in Florida. They're going through a big one tonight. It's going to arrive tonight, sometime around midnight, a little before midnight, and we're praying for them and asking God to keep them all safe. All those people, I've never seen a hurricane like that. I don't know. So often they talk about it and they talk, talk, talk, because they want you to watch. This is the real deal. This is a bad one, and we have some great governors, great Republican governors that are in charge, and I think they'll do a phenomenal job. [cheers and applause] I think they're going to do a phenomenal job. But here are some facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders. Actually, rated even worse than Pocahontas. Has anyone heard of Pocahontas? She was an original creator of Defund the Police Movement and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States. She was one of the originals, Defund the Police. We wanted to defund the police. You saw when she went up to Minnesota and she was bailing people out that wanted to burn down everything. Remember? They said, ""Oh, it's a friendly protest."" This poor, poor idiot from CNN News Stand, remember? He said, ""This is a friendly—"" Then he got hit in the leg with a rock or something, a hand grenade. He went down. Remember? He went down. He went down. This is a friendly protest. Oh, this is very friendly. And behind him the entire city of Minneapolis was burning. It looked like the Second World War. No, it was friendly.
That's a terrible thing, but she wanted to bail out all those people that did that and cause death. She wanted to get—She got a lot of them out. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty for all illegals. She wants mass amnesty for people that have literally looked to destroy our country. It's all will go to one thing. It's going to bankrupt your Medicare, bankrupt your social security. We mention again, 325,000 migrant children dead or in slavery right now, and just plain missing. She was the attorney general of the state of California. She redefined child sex trafficking. These are words or phrases, ""assault with a deadly weapon"" and ""rape of an unconscious person"". She said, ""From now on, they will be called nonviolent crimes,"" and reduced sentences accordingly. [booing] She pledged to confiscate your gun. She's going to take away your guns. I didn't let anybody touch that. Not an easy issue. I didn't let anybody—Does anybody in the room, please raise your hand, have a gun? [cheers and applause]
That's a tough job. She wants to confiscate your guns and endorse a total ban of handgun ownership. What do you do when a bad guy comes into your house? What do you do? A bad guy walks in and he's got whichever gun you have. If you don't have a gun, you're in big trouble, right? I mean, you need to have—That's what they have the Second Amendment for. You know, the city with the strongest—The city with the strongest gun legislation, ""You can't have a gun. You can't get near it. You go to jail forever."" It's a place called Chicago, and that's got the worst problem, right? That's got the worst problem. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. [booing] All paid for by the taxpayer. In other words, if you're being detained and you want a sex change, you can get—By the way, aside from the obvious, not such a great idea. It's a very, very expensive operation. And perhaps most revealing of all, she lied all about so many different things, but she lied about that little thing called McDonald's. She never worked there. And yesterday, Tampon Tim said—You know why they call them that? Because they sell tampons with special legislation in boys' locker rooms. Can you believe it? Says he's a freak. I'm not allowed to say that. I'm not allowed to say that. By the way, can you imagine if this guy happened along, right? Can you even believe this? And yesterday, Tampon Tim said they want to abolish the Electoral College, taking away all electoral power basically from the voters of places like Pennsylvania. Tim and comrade Kamala are really a true threat. They are a true threat to democracy. I'm not a threat to democracy. I'm the one that's going to save democracy. I'm the one that's going to save it. [cheers and applause] I'm going to save democracy. They are a threat to democracy and they really are too. Also, a big thing that's a threat is incompetence, is a threat to democracy. It really is. Because much of the stuff they do, I think, is incompetence. But she's surrounded by very smart, very vicious people that have to be—that are very radical left lunatics, okay? But they are smart. In some cases, genius. Look what they could do with elections. Look what they do. They're smart and we have to be very careful. I talk about the enemy from within. They're the enemy from within. We have the enemy on the outside and the enemy from within and the enemy—
Let's say you talk China, Russia, North Korea. You talk about different places. If you have a smart president, that's not going to be a problem. But the enemy from within is a very sick group of people. I can tell you because I had to go through years of, ""Russia, Russia, Russia,"" and they knew it was fake. They knew it was fake. How about this? I have a son, Don, who's a great guy. He knew less about Russia. He knew less about Russia, David, than—There's nobody in this room. Is there a child in the room? A child? Is there a young child? Huh? No, he's not that young man. He's about 70 years old. She's pointing to a guy that's like in his—Where is—yeah.
Okay, so you take a child. You take a child who's five years old. He knows more about Russia than my son. He knew nothing, and yet Adam shifty Schiff came out of an intelligence hearing, and he said, ""Donald Trump Jr. will go to jail for what he did with Russia."" Just understand, the whole thing was a made-up scam by him and crooked Hillary and all these people. It was a scam.
It turned out to be—and the writers at the New York Times got Pulitzer Prizes for their excellent journalism. No, but the thing turned out to be a scam. And then they admitted they were wrong. And we're suing the Pulitzer Foundation. We're saying, we're demanding that they retract the Pulitzer Prizes, with damages, and we're doing very well in that case. But think of it. Think of it. He knows nothing about—and I call him. I say, ""Are you okay?"" He said, ""Yeah, dad, I know nothing about what they're talking about. I have nothing to do with Russia. Absolutely."" Here's a sleazebag that goes out and says my son is going to go to jail on a con job that he made up along with Hillary and some of the others. Now think of it. How bad do you have to be to do that?
He knows it's a phony story. They got caught and now they've all admitted it was a con, it was a hoax, as we said, a scam, and they tell me my son's going to go to jail, and they all know it's a hoax. These are sick people. These are bad people, and we got to beat them and we got to beat them badly, and we got to get them the hell out of there. We're going to get them out. [cheers and applause] With your vote this November, we're going to defeat these radical-left lunatics, and we're going to finish the job that we so brilliantly started. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Think of it, what we had going. On day one, I will seal the border. I will stop the migrant invasion, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
I don't want to do that. I have a heart. I have a bigger heart than most of the people in this room, let me tell you, but you have no choice. It's not—it's not sustainable. We have to get them out, and we start with the worst of the criminals. We start with the drug lords. We start with the worst of the criminals. The illegal migrants coming into our country are taking the jobs of American citizens, the Black and Hispanic communities in particular; the Black communities, the Hispanic communities, and the unions are coming next. You watch. They're going to go after the unions. They're doing it and they're here, and they shouldn't be here. I will end inflation, and I will make America affordable again. [cheers and applause]
I will fight for and protect social security and Medicare. There'll be no cuts. There'll be no cuts, and we won't be raising the age like they're going to end up doing. They'll be raising social security by five or six years. You watch. Very soon. Very soon they're going to do it because it's not sustainable what they're doing. We will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate. I will stop outsourcing and turn the U.S. into a manufacturing superpower. Working with Elon Musk, we will slash a record amount of government waste. [cheers and applause] I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. We will prevent World War III. [cheers and applause]
I will crush the violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and the respect that they so dearly deserve. Our police are great. We're going to give them back their authority. It's been taken away. They destroy our police. They take away their house, their family, their car. They take away their pension. They want to do their job. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. I will support universal school choice. [cheers and applause] We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools immediately, and we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty and restore free speech, and we will secure finally our elections. We will secure them. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. [cheers and applause] We want a landslide that is too big to rig. We want to have it too big to rig. Early voting is underway. Get everyone you know and vote, vote, vote. Get out there and vote. After all we've been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. With your help now until election day, this is such an important little period of time. We will redeem America's promise. We will put America first, and we will take back the nation that we all love. We love our nation. [cheers and applause]
As an example, I didn't need this. I could be in the most beautiful beach in the world right now. Instead, I'm in the Commonwealth, which is okay with me. I like this better. A lot of people are in the beach. No, this is much better and much more important. It has nothing to do with like. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country, and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause] We will make America proud again. And we will Make America Great Again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much everybody. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you. Get out and vote. God bless you.

    ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump! [cheers and applause]
[music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA"".]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Ahh, this is some crowd. What a group. I know so many of the people, all these people. They're tough as hell. They're from Georgia, they should be tough. [cheers] I want to just say a special hello to Georgie. You have a lot of excitement going on outside. You know that, right? Right, Kelly? We have a lot of excitement going on outside. We're doing very well, they tell me, but one day is not too much, but looks like we're doing pretty well.
What do you think? [cheers and applause] Congressman Barry, huh? I hear we're doing well. I'm thrilled to be back in the incredible state with thousands of proud hardworking American patriots, which is what you are. You are hard workers and it's going to pay off.
We're going to take back our country. We're going to turn it around so fast. [cheers and applause] Before we begin, I want to send our love and prayers to everyone here in Georgia hit by the hurricanes. You got hit hard. As well as Florida, North Carolina, they really got hit hard. South Carolina got hit pretty hard. Virginia, Alabama, and Tennessee. That's a lot of hurricane. That was a big hurricane. I thought we were over.
[speaking to crowd member] Yeah, that's Trump country, you're right. It's Trump country. It is indeed. We love it. We love the people. [cheers and applause]
We wish they took better care of Trump country, right? Our hearts are with the families of every citizen who is tragically lost and all of the people who lost their home.
A lot of homes were lost too. A lot of people were lost. The citizens of Georgia are tough and resilient, and this state is going to come back stronger than ever. We're going to make sure it comes back stronger than ever. And I want to thank you, Governor Brian Kemp—[cheers and applause] he's done a really good job, and his staff for the work he's done and they've done. And God bless you all. Despite the storm, early mail-in voting in your state is now underway and early in-person is underway. But I'll tell you what, I'm hearing very good things now. It hasn't been going on too long, but we're seeing numbers. They're saying, ""Wow, those are big numbers.""
In fact, they set a record for the number of ballots today, right? A number, right? [cheers and applause] So if you have a ballot, return it immediately. If not, go tomorrow. As soon as you can, go to the polls and vote. Then for the next 21 days, get everyone you know to get out and vote.
We don't want to take a chance. We can't lose this country. If we're not successful, we're going to lose our country.
From the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our nation from a failed and corrupt political establishment. And are they corrupt? [cheers]
$500,000 for a painting. That's not good, is it, huh? I said, ""Well, that one, they'll never get away with, Byron."" I said, ""No way."" How did Byron do? Did he do a good job of it? [applause]
Great. Great guy. Stand up, Byron. Big star. Barry, he's gonna be—he's gonna be, be a big star, this guy. Do I have him right? He's going to be a big, big—He already is a big star, if you get right down to it.
Thank you very much. Good job. I heard every word. I was taking pictures. I said, ""Well, that guy's doing a good job.""
And to give you back the country that you believe in, the country you were born in, and the country that you deserve, that's what you want. Everywhere you look, under Kamala Harris, the American standard of living is in a free fall. Nothing works. Have you ever noticed nothing works? It's like everything they touch turns to—uh I won't say it.
No, everything they touch, including their rescue plan, which they didn't even have a plan. You're working more hours for less money to afford smaller houses, worse cars, fewer groceries with absolutely nothing left to save. Our schools don't teach. Our cities aren't safe. Illegal aliens are pouring in by the millions and millions and millions, and we're teetering on the brink of World War III. Other than that, I think we're doing quite well.
Kelly's saying, ""Man, this is really depressing.""
But exactly three week—and uh look, we're down to the wire now, wouldn't you think, huh? Three weeks from tonight, the people of Georgia are going to end Kamala Harris's reign of failure. [cheers and applause]
And we are going to launch a new golden age of American success for the citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It's going to be a golden time. And I wanna congratulate—I want to thank a man named Elon Musk because he did a big favor. [cheers and applause] He did. When I was down here, early on, I was down and we were with the folks and they were going, ""Sir, we need Starlink."" I said, ""What the hell is Starlink?"" He said, ""Do you know Elon Musk is the most incredible thing."" Because, specially in North Carolina, they had no communication whatsoever. Right, Barry? They were just wiped out and they had no communication and it's hard to get. It's hard to get, so I called up Elon and he endorsed me.
He gave me the greatest endorsement. And how about that rocket, the way it came in yesterday? Was that crazy? [applause] Was that crazy? I was on the phone with somebody and I have the television on, no sound or anything, and I'm looking at the screen, but I'm talking to somebody, I guess couldn't have been that interesting a person. [laughter] And I'm watching the screen and this big monster, the thing's like 20 stories tall, and it's coming down, the fires pouring out of it from all angles. And I say, ""I don't know. Could you hold on a minute? There's something happening on—I've never seen anything like this."" Brandon.
The great Brandon Beach. Does everybody know Brandon? Great. Thank you, Brandon. What a good patriot he is. But I said, ""I've never seen anything like this.""
So it's coming down, down, down. And I said, ""Oh, man, it's going to be terrible. It's going to hit the gantry,"" or whatever they call it, ""It's going to hit. It's going to knock it over."" Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's going to knock it over. It's going to knock it on its ass like you knock your competitors on their ass, Marjorie. [cheers and applause] Right? And she is highly respected, let me tell you. Smart.
So, it's coming down and I didn't like the angle. I said, ""Come on, baby."" And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring from the right side. It's strange. Boom. I mean the thing—and I said, ""That was amazing."" And I forgot the guy that was on the phone. They have a certain respect where we're leading everybody, so they hold on forever. You know, they would've—Doug, they would've held on for an hour, but I just totally forgot because I've never seen anything—
I said, ""Elon, could you do me a favor? Starlink."" ""Yes. What would you like about it?"" I said, ""They need hundreds of them in North Carolina and also in Georgia. They really want them in Georgia too because they lost their wires. They're down."" And I'm talking to him. And as I'm talking, I get a call from somebody in North Carolina, ""Thank you for the Starlink."" And I said, ""How the hell did you do that?"" [cheers and applause]
No, it's true. Elon, he's different. No, he's different. I said, ""Elon, I don't know what Starlink is, but they like it, they like it."" But no, it was funny because I'm on the phone and it's all done. And I'll tell you what, it got here and it was delayed once it got here.
Bad things happened. You know it's happened with a lot of people, but ultimately, they got it. And I said, ""How does it compare to the lines?"" They said, ""It's better."" And the guy just is a fantastic guy. So we want to thank him for his big endorsement. And he really is—and you know where he is right now? He's in Pennsylvania campaigning for me. Is that great? [cheers and applause] He's in Pennsylvania campaigning. And we were in Butler, Pennsylvania honoring Corey, the firefighter who lost his life. Two other good guys, by the way. Two other very good guys, but he lost his life. And Elon was there and he wore the black hat. I did not know we had a black hat. It's black with black letters, okay?
And he called it dark MAGA. And he hasn't taken it off. And he loves that hat. No, but we want to thank him. He's been really great. He's a great patriot. He's a brilliant guy too. I said, ""Does anybody else do that with the rockets because I've been watching this stuff for a long time?"" Byron, have you ever seen that before? I said, ""Can the Russians do it?"" ""No."" ""Can NASA do it?"" ""No."" ""Can anybody do it?"" ""No, only me."" I said, ""Keep it going, man. That's pretty cool."" [laughter] It's the coolest thing I've seen in a long time. [applause] Pretty cool. We got to protect our brilliant people. We got to remember that. There aren't too many brilliant people around.
Not too many, right, Marjorie? Marjorie knows better than anybody. There aren't too many.
Oh, you're Lieutenant Governor is right there. Look at this. We have big power, huh? Thank you, both. [applause]
With your vote, we will create millions of new great-paying jobs, wages will soar, your taxes—your taxes are going to fall. You saw that? Your net worth will skyrocket. America will be confident again. You know America has lost its confidence. It's a terrible thing to say. I said it one time and I said, ""You know it's actually true."" But it's going to come back very quickly. America will be respected again. The American people will be optimistic again and you will be proud of the life and the future you are going to give and giving to your children. Our legacy will be nothing less than the rebirth of the American dream.
You don't hear about the American dream anymore. You don't hear about—we used to hear about the American dream. My father used to say, ""You want to live the American Dream, son."" And I said, ""What's the American dream, Dad?"" And I didn't quite make it. I wanted to make it. [laughter] Now, I could have the American dream. You know what? I had the American dream. Did I need this? But I wouldn't swap it. I wouldn't swap it, Byron.
I was saying yesterday, ""I could be on the waters of Monte Carlo. I could be all over the world enjoying myself, but I'd much rather be right here with you."" It's true because we have a mission. We have a mission. And we don't have a choice. You know we really don't have a choice.
Somebody said, ""Why are you doing this?"" I said, ""Because we don't have a choice. We're going to make America great again. What's better than that?""
I have a lot of rich friends. They go here, they go there. They're boring as hell. Nobody cares. They put on their bathing suit. They don't look a lot better than Biden, except they have fancier beaches, right?
And look what we're doing. We're doing something. If we win this election, it will be the greatest event, political event or otherwise, in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
And we're going to turn it around fast. It's going to go very quickly. We're going to turn it around fast. Kamala is turning us into a third-world nation, which is true. [booing]
You know, I didn't know she didn't pass her bar exam. Did you know that?
I'm just—I'm hearing this. I don't want to tell you about it. Please, I don't want to. I don't wanna mention. I will not mention the fact that she didn't pass her bar exam, so I'm not going to mention that.
But with our victory, we'll become the greatest, strongest, freest, safest, and the most powerful nation the world has ever seen. We're going to put it back together fast. [cheers and applause]
Four years ago we were respected, now they laugh at us. Other countries laugh at us. I had a good interview today with Bloomberg. Did anybody see that? That was a great interview. He was a Trump hater and brilliantly, my staff didn't tell me that. I said, ""Who is this guy?"" ""Sir, he hates you very much. He's been after you."" So they got me all started before I went up, but it was a great interview. And I think it really showed the plan that we have because he was unable to dispute it. We're going to bring so many companies back into our country, and a lot of them are going to be based right here, right in the great state of Georgia. There's going to be a lot of things happening. It's going to happen very fast.
Remember, I used to say, ""We're winning too much""? You're going to say to me, Marjorie is going to come with the Lieutenant Governor and Doug and Kelly's going to be there. Got a lot of cash, I'll tell you. [laughter] And Loudermilk, he's coming in with this beautiful family.
And you're going to be begging me. You're going to be saying, ""Please, sir, there are too many companies coming into Georgia. Please, we can't take it anymore. We don't have enough people for the jobs. [cheers and applause] Please, we don't want any more companies. We don't want any companies."" That was the takeoff on the winning. We're going to win so much. You're going to come, ""Please, sir, we can't win anymore. We're winning too much."" We had a lot of fun. And we had a lot of fun.
We have a new one now. All those companies are going to be pouring in.
But starting on day one, I will quickly defeat inflation and we're going to bring down the energy prices fast. Liquid gold. And we will make America affordable again.
Prices are still going up. They're going up again, and they surged again very viciously last month. And here we go again. And Kamala Harris—she has no idea what's happening. They say, ""What do you think of inflation?"" ""What?"" ""What do you think of inflation?"" ""Huh?""
She didn't know what the hell they were talking about. Other than that, she just got it right under toe, right? She didn't really know what they were talking about when they said inflation. ""What is it?""
Kamala Harris has developed a policy. You know what her plan is called? I have no plan to fix it—that's what. She says, ""I have no plan to fix it."" She's changed 15 policies. You know on occasion, somebody will run and change one, like they'll be for the death penalty or not for the—
She's changed 15 policies. No fracking, no this. Every single thing she's changed. Go back a year and a half and take a look, 15 policies. I've never seen anyone get away with one major change. The whole thing is different.
She loves walls now. She loves walls. [laughter] She loves our police, but she was in charge of defund the police. Do you go from a defunder of the police? I don't think so. Lieutenant Governor, from— do you go from a defunder? She was a leader of defund the police. And now she says, ""I love the police."" In the meantime, every police group in the nation is supporting me. [cheers and applause]
And the Border Patrol came out. Did you see that? The Border Patrol came out. [cheers and applause]
Thousands and thousands of them came out. Two nights ago when they endorsed Trump, they said, ""We endorse—"" Paul gave a beautiful speech. Incredible people. I know them all very well. They never met her. They never spoke to her. They were asked, ""Did you ever get a call from anybody in Border Patrol?"" ""Yes."" ""Did you ever call them back?"" ""No."" They never once spoke to anybody even in authority or not authority, nobody, they never spoke.
And here we have the biggest travesty. I believe it's a bigger problem because of the murderers and everything else coming into it. I believe, look, inflation and the economy are always big. And they're big, what they've done to our economy. But I really believe that the border and the illegal immigration and 21 million people, many of them criminals, is a bigger thing than inflation. [cheers]
I may be wrong. I may be wrong, but I think so. [applause] It's rated number three after the economy and inflation. I put them sort of together, economy, inflation. I think they sort of belong together. What do you think? I think so.
But I think the biggest thing is when you have 13099 murderers, people that are—four people that were ready for to be executed, they said rather than executing them we'll let them come into America. 13099, many of them, many of them killed more than one person. And they're happily ensconced in Georgia. They're all over the country. And these are killers. These are people that will kill you quickly. They don't need too much of an excuse. They have, as they say—they have as they say, a short fuse. Uh you don't want to get into a little tiny argument that for somebody else would be an argument for them, it's not good, right? It's not a good situation for you.
We don't want them in this country. We're getting them out of this country fast. Fast. [cheers and applause] And I think it's a bigger I think it's bigger than the economy. I think it's bigger, it's horrible. Inflation is a country buster. It's busted many countries, but I think it's bigger than inflation, even. Over the past four years, her inflation nightmares cost the typical family $29000.
Think of that, $29000 in inflation. The reason you feel poorer is thanks to Kamala. And that's the fact is you are. And she was the one, they called her the taxing queen in San, you know she destroyed San Francisco. San Francisco, if you go back 18, 19 years ago, it was the number-one city. It was the best city in the country. Now it's not even livable. And I speak against myself.
You know I own property in San Francisco. I own a lot of property. I own property in California. And every time I say this, I say, I'm saying, please don't say it in my—please because every time I say it, I depreciate the value of my property. [laughter] Guys that would've said, I love that place you have and I own on the water the most gorgeous things right on the ocean. I always say I have the ocean.
Pebble Beach only has the bay. That's in my head. And I never even need it because it's always full. But I have the ocean. Pebble Beach has the bay. The truth is, every time I speak this way, I hurt the value of my properties. But ultimately I don't give a damn cause this is much more important. [applause]
She destroyed—along with Gavin Newsom, the governor, Gavin Newsom, they destroyed, the two of them, what she did to San Francisco. And then she became Attorney General. What she did to California is a disgrace. And now she wants to do that to the United States of America. We're not going to let that happen, Marjorie, [booing] her plan will raise taxes for the typical American family by an estimated $3000. Take a look at this.

CLIP : [TAX CUTS AND INCREASES]
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax bill.
UNNAMED INTERVIEWERS: Calling for a full repeal of President Trump's tax cuts if Kamala Harris was elected president, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy, but the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire. Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut. Americans will face a hike. The Tax Foundation finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
UNNAMED INTERVIEWER: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
[crosstalk among unnamed commentators]: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee. [booing]
NARRATOR: Don't let Kamala Harris fool you. Harris not only supports taxing service workers' tips, news reports confirm Biden and Harris have weaponized the IRS to confiscate your tip money. Harris and Biden have literally unleashed the IRS to harass workers who receive tips and they just may be coming to your house next. Only President Trump has a plan that ends all taxes on service workers' tips. President Trump, he's on your side.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: You know, the only problem with putting it up, the fake news and there's a lot of them back there, [booing] so I have a lot of friends, no, I have a lot of friends, they watch the rallies on television. This isn't a rally, this is just a get-together. Look at it all the way up to the bleachers. [cheers and applause]
But they watch. Hello up there. It's a nice place. But they watch, a friend of mine goes, he says the only problem is when you put up the videos, they don't show it on television. You know why? Because they don't want to move the camera a little bit up? They don't want to because they don't want do anything that's good for us. They don't want to do anything that's good for us.
And you know what? They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I'm going to ask them to put on woke—Do you know what this is all about? We don't have a woke military, but some people think there are some people in the top. Can you put that woke military, put it up, the master sergeant.

DRILL SERGEANT: 1, 2, 3, 4, United States Marine Corps.
TRAINEES IN FORMATION: 1, 2, 3, 4, United States Marine Corps.
TRUMP: So we won two beautiful, big, horrible in many ways, but we won two world wars with that attitude. And uh we didn't win with the woke stuff. But our military is not woke. We have some people on the top that are woke. They'll be gone so fast your head will spin. Okay? [cheers and applause]
Under the Trump administration, we will put more money in your pocket. We will let you keep more money than you ever thought possible. We're bringing it down. We're bringing the costs down. We will have large tax cuts for workers and we are going to have something very special. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. [cheers and applause]
That's a big one. And you deserve it. You know what, you put up with inflation for the last two and a half years, that shouldn't have ever been here, would've never been here. Think of it. We wouldn't have had the war with Russia and Ukraine. No way Russia would've done it. We wouldn't have had—you wouldn't have had October 7th with Israel. You wouldn't have had inflation.
You wouldn't have had that horrible, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, the way they withdrew. We were going to withdraw. But we're also going to keep Bagram, the biggest military base in the world. We gave it to China. You know who has it now? China has it one hour away from where they make their nuclear weapons.
And on that day we lost 13 great soldiers and many were obliterated. No arms, no legs. The face was just disastrous. What these people—nobody ever mentions them, but we had a lot of people badly, badly hurt. And what a shame. What a shame to see what's happened to our country, the border, all of the things that we've suffered in the last almost four years. We're going to get it back so fast. We're going to be proud again. We're going to be very proud of our country. [cheers and applause]
Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter? What do you think, Byron? It's better, right? [cheers and applause] Huh? Did you see when her teleprompter crashed last? She was talking about 32 days, Mr. Congressman 32. She goes, and the election will be in 32 days. 32 days. The teleprompter crashed. 32 days. She kept going. I would've loved to—you know it kicked back in. It's called a kickback. Like some people know a lot about a kickback. It's called a kickback. They know in this administration. But no, it's a kickback. It kicks back in and it did kick back in just in time because she was about ready to eat the—Byron goes, yeah, this was—when you do this, you have to have one ability. If the teleprompter goes, because it goes, I figured 5% of the time it goes, it's gone.
And you're standing up in front all of the fake news, which is actually a much bigger audience than this because you've got millions of people watching. So you're standing in front of the fake news with fake reporters and you know some very bad, and some good ones and some good ones. I'd say 5%, right? What do you think, Byron? 5%? I think so. 5%, maybe less.
But, and if that happens, and if you don't do this well, you are ridiculed the following day, right? And I've had to go off with Bernie Marino in Ohio, I was doing very well, but I had 57000 people out there, television blazing. And he's going for the nomination and it wasn't looking good. The wind was blowing at 49 miles an hour.
And I got onto the stage and I'm looking at these two things and they were like [Trump waves hands to represent wind]—so you can't read them. But I said, ""Don't worry about that. They're going to blow off."" And within the first minute they blew off the stage. They were like 30 yards down the road. And I'm standing there. And that's when you find out whether or not you have what it takes, right? [cheers and applause] You're up there all by yourself. You're up there all by yourself, Mr. lieutenant governor, and you better get going.
And you can't do that 32 stuff that she was doing. Why? Why did he have to fix that damn teleprompter? But it is true. I have a friend, he just wants to go into politics, but he's petrified of, he said, ""I have one phobia."" He's a very smart guy, very rich guy. He wants so much to be in politics. I said, ""Do you have any problems?"" Well, I have a problem with—I have a phobia against public speaking. I said, ""Don't go into politics. If you have that phobia, I would not bother.""
Right? What do you think Byron? No good, right? He wouldn't come up and warm up the crowd like you did. He'd stand there, get me off.
To crush inflation we will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill baby, drill. She won't frack. She's not going to frack.
She's not going to frack. Pennsylvania, please. Pennsylvania. Remember, she's not fracking. Her whole life is, we will not frack. We will not frack. She's gone through a whole life like this. All of a sudden, oh, I look forward to fracking. No it doesn't.
I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. You're going to get them in half, 50% in 12 months because we have liquid gold. [cheers and applause]
Nobody else has it. We became number one with me. Number one in the world in oil, we have oil and gas. Number one. Russia was number two. Saudi Arabia was number one. We were number three or number four. When I left, we were so far above them and we were going to be not only, we were energy independent, we were going to be energy dominant. We were going to sell to Asia, we were going to sell. We were going to pay off a lot of debt. We were all set to go.
And then we had a great election because we got millions more votes. But there's something happened a little bit. We can't let that happen again. We're not going to let that happen.
Look what happens when bad things like that happen.
I will cancel Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate immediately. [cheers and applause]
Everybody will drive an electric car, they say. And soon the problem is they don't go far. They're very expensive. They're made in China and they have some other things. Now, with that being said, I think they're phenomenal. They really are.
I say that because of Elon.
Elon, they are phenomenal by the way. But for certain, whatever, and we're going to have hybrids, we're going to have gasoline-propelled cars. We're not going to have hydrogen cars. You know, hydrogen cars is the new thing, right? Do you know about that? Hydrogen is the new car. They say it's great. Has one problem.
If it explodes, you're dead. If it explodes. They actually say if it explodes, you're unrecognizable. You call your wife over, they call up the wife, would you please come here and take a look and see whether or not this is your husband because we cannot see. And she goes to the nearest tree, which is about 100 yards away, and she says, no, it's only blood. There's nothing there. She says, ""I can't tell.""
So hydrogen has one problem. It's extraordinarily dangerous. Other than that, the car works quite well, actually. I won't get near. I will never get, I don't care how good it becomes. No matter—and they'll probably say they're making it safe, but it'll never be safe enough for us, congressmen. I also announced last week that we will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible—[cheers and applause] because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream.
I got a call from a big guy on Wall Street, says, ""Where the hell did you come up with that idea?"" Think of how simple that is. How great is that? Because now we're going to make more cars because of it, right? They said, ""Where did you come up?"" When you think it's so simple? It was mentioned to me by somebody a week ago.
I said, has nobody, I think—a car loan deductible. Wouldn't that be nice? It's going to spur the industry, but what's really going to spur the industry is what we're doing with taxes and tariffs. Every company's going to come pouring back. But the interest deduction is so great. And I say it's like the paperclip. 125 years ago, a guy took a piece of metal and he started playing games with it, and he had the paperclip. And now since then, everybody that's seen the paperclip says, shit, why didn't I think of that?
It's so simple. That's like that for the car loans, right? It was so simple. Nobody thought. The biggest guy in Wall Street called me the smartest guy. He's got like 183 IQ. He said, ""Where the hell did you come up with that idea? That's pretty good."" As we rebuild our economy, we will also restore our borders, if you don't mind. [applause]
For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails and insane asylums and the worst mental institutions anywhere in the world, not South America, all over the world. They come from Venezuela. They come from the Congo in Africa, and she has resettled them very nicely into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens, right?
When I went on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It's going to be a restoration. [cheers and applause] One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs, they're nice people, the only thing nice about them, they make our criminals look like nice people. Because now we say, I thought those guys were tough. They were really not tough. Not compared to these guys.
Remember when she said, migrants coming in do not cause crime? Really? Check out the front page of the New York Post today. They've taken over Midtown Manhattan,
But one of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. Have you heard of them? Tren de Aragua. In Aurora, Colorado, and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. And they are really going and they are vicious as hell. Take a look at it—

[text overlay, ""End the Occupation Liberate America""]
TRUMP: And that's number one. That's number one. I will tell you right now. That beats out the economy. That beats it all out. To me, it's not even close. The United States is now an occupied country, but on November 5th 2024, that will be Liberation Day in America. Liberation Day. [cheers and applause]
Thank you.
So sad.
This is what you call an unforced error. What they've done to this country, and to think that she's running for the President of the United States is a disgrace, and she's allowed millions of these people into our country, destroying our country. And it's not easy to fix either. We'll get some and we'll get them out. Then they'll get somebody else who has a nice look and a child, and it'll be the poster. It'll be, ""Oh, how horrible are we?"" It's a very tough thing to fix, but we're going to fix it because we have no choice.
But we're going to start with these horrible criminals, and there are lots of them. 425,000 illegal aliens, convicted of crimes, are now free to roam in our country, including all of those murderers and all of those drug dealers and all of the human traffickers in women, in women.
They traffic in women. You hear children, you hear men. No, they traffic, really, in women. Right here, in Georgia, our nation was robbed of a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student, Laken Riley, you know Laken very well now. [applause]
And after months of prodding him, Biden couldn't pronounce her name, he said Lincoln Riley, and Lincoln Riley's the football coach. And this was in Congress. Couldn't even get the name right. Laken was a brilliant young student, top in her class, going to be a great nursing student. Everybody admired her. She was killed viciously. While out on a jog, she was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically murdered by an illegal alien. You saw the picture from Venezuela. The savage monster who murdered Laken was let in and released into our country by Kamala Harris. She came in through open borders. Nobody even checked him. Come right in. Come right in.
His brother was also in Georgia illegally. He suspected of viciously murdering someone also in the Venezuelan gang. He's in that gang. In September, an illegal alien who Kamala imported through her open border process was arrested in Tennessee for strangling a 25-year-old girl to death and leaving her body covered in blankets for days.
Her parents, oh, her parents. All of these parents. They'll never be the same. He had a prior arrest record in the United States, was shielded for deportation by the horrible, horrible laws, rules, and regulations of Kamala. I can't believe how they allowed this country to become like this. This country is not—It can't go on like this. And they're getting worse. You look at little towns, villages, cities, and even the big cities, they're petrified that this is going to happen to them.
The Governor of Colorado is a radical-left Democrat, but he just doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know what to do.
Springfield, Ohio. We love Ohio. We won Ohio every time, by a lot. We're leading now by a lot. And I know Springfield, beautiful little place. 50,000 people. They've just deposited 32,000 illegal migrants into the town. They don't speak English, but they've taken up the schools. They don't speak English. What they're looking for is interpreters because they have no idea what they're going to do. Nobody speaks—very few of them speak English, so they're looking all over for interpreters. That's what they want to find.
When you go to the hospital, you can't get into the hospital because the hospital's all occupied. And they want to be so nice and they want to be politically correct. And the mayor seems like a nice person. He's saying, ""We'll figure out how to make it work."" But you can never figure it out. It can never work. Think of it, 50,000 people, all of a sudden they have 32,000. They've almost doubled the size with people that came from a rough country, really a rough country. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause]
Have to. Have to do it.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered. They've conquered our country. This is an invasion of a military force. They have weapons that are on par with our US military, but we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals to jail or kick them the hell out of our country, ideally the second.
Because we don't want to have to pay for the costs, so we'll ideally bring them back to their country. When I first came into the White House, a General came up, I said, ""General, I want to get MS-13 gangs. They're the worst in the world."" MS-13 is very similar, but probably even nastier. And we had thousands of them in our country because Barack Hussein Obama could not get them out, because the countries from where they came would put airplanes, big ones, on the runway, so you couldn't land. They wouldn't let the buses through. And they gave up. Years ago, they gave up.
And I said to the General, ""I want them out."" He said, ""Sir, they won't take them back."" I said, ""Who?"" And they said the countries. I won't embarrass them because I know the presidents very well. And they're very streetwise, very smart people. And I said, ""How much aid do we give those three countries?"" ""Sir, we give them $750 million a year."" And I said, ""Inform them that they're delinquent, that they aren't allowing us to bring back people that belong there and they're getting no further aid at all from the United States."" [cheers and applause]
And the following day, early in the morning, I got calls from all three separately. All three, "" Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding."" And I said, ""No, there isn't. You sent them over in a caravan."" The caravan. I made up that name too.
I'm good at names. You know the names. I can't use those names too much because many of them were for Republicans. We had some beauties, but we can use Pocahontas and other people. [laughter]
But I said, ""Listen,"" I said, ""You wouldn't take them back."" ""Sir, there seems to be a misunderstanding. We would love to take them back. We love MS-13 so much. Sir, please, please let us take them back. Sir, please."" And we sent them back and they took them like nothing. Like nothing. [cheers and applause]
We send them out of our country, and if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. That way, they're not coming back. That way, they're not coming back. And you don't hear these ideas from anyone else. I can tell you, and I'm not proud of them. But you also have to wage a little bit of common sense, don't you? Because we're the party of common sense. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. [applause]
Kamala's migrant invasion, and that's what it is, is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens and bringing drugs, crime and death to our country. And the African-American community and the Hispanic community is being devastated with the jobs.
The numbers are down six, seven, eight, 9%. They're going to work and they're saying, ""I'm sorry, we're not going to take you anymore."" People that have worked there, and worked there well for years, are now being told they no longer have a job because they have illegal immigrants coming in and taking their job. And I'll tell you what, any African American or Hispanic, and you know how well I'm doing there, that votes for Kamala, you got to have your head examined because they are really screwing you. They are really screwing you. [applause] Right? It's happening in numbers.
You're going to hear about it. It's a big story. It's a big story. You're going to start hearing about it in a little while. It's a big story. It's terrible, it's terrible. People that have been here for years, years, they've done a good job, they've got their family, and now all of a sudden, one day, they don't have a job anymore.
Kamala's open b order policy is a complete and total betrayal of African-American communities and Hispanic-American communities.
And unions are next. Oh, they're going to take on the unions. You watch. Virtually 100% of all of the jobs created in the last year have gone to migrants. I don't know if anybody knows that. First of all, the jobs that they got, which made their numbers look better, but they don't count really, they're bounce-back jobs. Those are jobs that we had. We had the greatest economy in history. We had to take a pause for the pandemic. We did a good job on that. And then the people, they call it bounce-back. It's standard, a very standard phrase, but they call it bounce-back. They bounce back. But think of it, of the jobs created, almost every one of those jobs was taken by a migrant. Under Trump, Americans will always come first. Take a look.

CLIP: [WOULD YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DIFFERENTLY]
ANA NAVARRO: [clip from Harris' interview on The View on 10/8/24] Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: There has not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 1: We stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
COMMENTATOR 2: The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan, stunned Americans at the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.
NAVARRO: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 3: More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder and been caught at the board, and then released into the United States.
COMMENTATOR 4: An Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
COMMENTATOR 5: Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia. Nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.
COMMENTATOR 6: Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela on charges of capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
COMMENTATOR 7: A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.
NAVARRO: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
COMMENTATOR 8: Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition.
COMMENTATOR 9: US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
LAURA INGRAHAM: The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
INTERVIEWER 1: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS : Yes.
TRUMP: So she would do nothing different. Think of it. You have the worst administration in the history of our country. The happiest person, you've heard me say this, Jimmy Carter, because he looks brilliant by comparison. His administration, by comparison, is brilliant. So he's happy. He's an old guy now, but he's a happy man.
Just this week, I was proud to receive the official and unanimous endorsement of America's Border Patrol agents. All 100%. All of them. [applause]
And I was also honored to receive the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police. Something they don't do easily. [applause] But they said, ""We have no choice. We have no choice."" 400,000 law enforcement officers nationwide.
So they did something to Biden that was amazing. They stole the election from him. I'm not a fan of Biden, who could be, but they stole the election. They took it away like candy from a baby. And he's angry. And they were all angry. They're angry as hell. I think he likes me more than he likes her. Can you believe it? I believe that. I believe that, Steve. He likes me more than her. Can you believe it?
But we will restore law and order in America. But here's what, to do it, you have to do one thing. I don't want your money. I don't want anything. I just want you to get out and vote and get your friends to vote. [applause] That's it. I don't want money. Just go and vote.
So we're pleased to be joined with some incredible people, friends of mine, talented people. You have a lot of great people in this state. Lieutenant Governor, Bert Jones. Please, Bert, stand up. [applause]
Members of Congress, Mike Collins. [applause] Mike, great guy, tough guy. You don't play games. He said, ""Oh, put me in that committee. I want to be in that committee to cut costs."" He'll do a better job. Nobody could do like that. Thanks, Mike.
Somebody that's been unbelievable at searching out really bad, sick politicians on the other side. He was accused of—He walked in with a couple of young constituents to show them the Capitol, as I remember it, and they accused him of showing in Russians. What? And he became—Instead of most people, they say, ""Oh, please,"" He became the opposite. Indignant and wild. And he has done some job on the committee. Barry Loudermilk.
We love you, Barry. Courage.
I remember that. You're supposed to have pictures of him walking around with two kids from the area and the parents. They were Russian. These people are sick. And all it did is made him angry. And you have done some jobs, so we appreciate it.
A man that we've said hello to, that you've experienced. He's got a big future. He is a fantastic guy and a friend of mine, Byron Donalds. [applause] Byron, thank you. A very strong, smart person.
A woman who is amazing, actually, to me. She's really amazing. Marjorie Taylor Green, thank you. [cheers and applause]
And another warrior who's always been with us, Rich McCormick. [applause] Where is Rich? Thank you. Thank you, Rich.
And a really good guy, a former congressman, so respected by everybody. Doug Collins. [applause] Thank you, Doug.
And your former Senator who was really a terrific person and respected so much in Washington and still is even I think even more respected now, Kelly Loeffler. Thank you, Kelly. Good job. [applause]
The next congressman from Georgia's third congressional district. He's worked with me since like 2015, before '16. And everybody, after they got to know him, they said, ""Could we use him too?"" There was nobody like him. He's going to be a congressman. I think he always wanted to be a congressman. And when the seat came up in his district where he grew up, I said, go ahead. And did he win? Man, did he win, Bert? What's going on with him? He's making us all look bad. He got so many votes. Brian Jack. Where's Brian Jack? [applause] Thank you. There he is.
There he is. Is he a natural or what? Everybody loves this guy. I love this guy. It's not my thing either, but I love him. He is a special character, that one. Are you enjoying it, Brian?
BRIAN JACK: Very much so.
TRUMP: Good. He's got the word. He got the whole deal. He's good. He's going to be good for a long time. Your Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King. [applause] Thank you, John, very much. Thank you, John. Thank you, John.
Public Service Commissioner, Bubba McDonald. Bubba. [applause] What a man. A very special state senator. I just met his daughter, you not believe it or not, I was at another place two hours ago. I've been doing this for 42 days straight without a rest. [cheers and applause]
You believe it? 42.
But two and a half hours ago I was in another little different part of your state and this beautiful young woman said, ""My father is Brandon Beach,"" and I'm much more impressed with him now than it was two and a half—This guy is such a great patriot, State Senator, Brandon Beach. Thank you. And your daughter is fantastic. She was so proud of you. I said, ""He's that good, isn't he, right?"" She said, ""He's even better than that."" You got a good daughter. So it was great to meet her.
Georgia GOP chairman, Josh McKoon. [cheers and applause] And he is good. He is good. So Josh, stand up for—how the hell—Are we doing well?
JOSH MCKOON: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: Are we doing as well as I'm hearing?
MCKOON: Yes, sir.
TRUMP: All right. That's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing—And we're no longer in poll territory, right? We're in territory of votes coming in. We're not really looking so much at polls anymore. The votes are coming in, and they're coming in at a nice level for us, right? He's done a fantastic job. Thank you, Josh. I appreciate it. [applause]
A woman who I've known for a long time, and she's always been there for us. She's a special woman, very religious person. Every time she sees me, she prays. And I say from you, I accept that, and I will always accept it. Alveda King. Thank you, Alveda. Thank you. [applause]
Good genes. She's got very good genes, beautiful genes.
And a friend of mine, one of the most successful business people in the country, a great, great developer from Florida, New York, and a lot of other places, but just a terrific person. And he's become—I think he loves politics, but he wants to just make sure we all do well. That's all he wants. Mr. Steve Witkoff. Steve. Thank you, Steve. Great. Thanks, Steve. [applause]
So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical-left Marxist, rated even worse than Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, that's Pocahontas. Remember? Her mother said she's Indian. Why? Because she's got high cheekbones. That was the reason. So I immediately called her Pocahontas, and that was the end of her. She was leading in the presidential race you know. And I don't think she likes me too much, but the mother said she had high cheekbones and I said, Pocahontas.
And then all the hell—the world went crazy.
And she actually went out and got a test, remember? And she was so happy. 1000th 24. In other words, maybe a million years ago there was a possibility, but she was happy. She said, this proves I'm an Indian.
And I said, no, no, I have more Indian blood in me, and I don't have any. I'd love to, but I don't have any. And that was the end of her presidential run. That was the end. I did the world a favor. Of course, look what we got. Look what we got.
Kamala destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being president of the United States. It's a radical left person. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She wants to let her millions of illegal—Medicare. Oh, she wants to raid Medicare. That's what they're going to do. Raid Medicare, Social Security. She wants to ban fracking. As California Attorney General, that's what she did. And she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes.
She said they're nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorse the total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. And here's something she did that was terrible. And here's something she did that was terrible, on her resume, she said she worked at McDonald's. She never worked at McDonald's.
So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and save America. [cheers and applause] Right? We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We're going to do that. It's not going to even be hard. We are going to do it through low taxes and high tariffs, actually.
We won't have any inflation, and we're going to do it. We're going to have a boom, and the auto industry is going to boom like it's never boomed before. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause]
I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the U.S. into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. I can do that.
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect they so dearly—I'll tell you what, we have to give our police—We have to take care of our police and it's turning out to be more dangerous than ever. And once we give them that power back, it will be much less dangerous than ever. But right now, being a policeman or a policewoman is very dangerous. We have to give them back their honor, and we have to shield them, and we're going to indemnify them against being hurt because they do something that's good, and they lose their family, they lose their pension, they lose their house, they lose everything.
Now we're going to indemnify them. If they're right, and we're going to find that most of them—they're going to right—And you always have bad apples. It's a shame. It's a horrible thing. But sometimes, you have to just say, but we always have bad apples and we'll do everything we can to get those bad apples the hell out.
But we have to take care of our police and our law enforcement. That's why our country is going to hell with crime.
We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield all around our country, and it'll be made right here. A lot of it's going to be made, as you know, you do a lot of it, it's going to be made in the USA, but it's going to be made a lot of it right here.
And we will put the stars and stripes on the surface of Mars very soon. Very soon. [cheers and applause] We will get Elon to get those rockets going, Elon, get them going, get them going.
He is going to send a rocket up very soon to pick up the two guys. How would you like to be stuck in space? I said, when are you sending that? Very soon. I'm just about ready to send it. It's like sending a bus for him.
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. They will get critical—Oh, and we will do this. Critical race theory and transgender insanity will be out of our schools immediately. [cheers and applause] Immediately.
And we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.
And the Second Amendment is under siege. You know that the Second Amendment is under siege. It will not be—Four years it was under siege, I will tell you. But we're going to protect our Second Amendment a hundred percent. [applause]
After years of built—Thank you. After years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburbs, cities, and towns. We're going to protect our country. We will end the sanctuary cities immediately and stop illegal immigration once and for all. No more sanctuary cities. [applause]
We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first, American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first, we will put our country first.
We will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last and they will always stay last. From Savannah to Columbus, from Marietta to Macon, and from Augusta to Atlanta, we inherit the legacy of red-blooded American patriots who poured out their blood, sweat, and tears to defend this country they love. [cheers and applause]
We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those big beautiful skyscrapers. You're welcome.
Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. And we are not going to lose the nation that they worked for and fought for and died for. We are not going to lose it. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will defeat the enemy at all levels of combat. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again. [cheers and applause]
Right?
CROWD: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with the opportunity and hope of a lifetime.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide that's too big, too big. We can't let anything happen.
Early voting is underway. Get everyone out. Get everyone you know, just get them all out to vote. Go tomorrow.
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be despite the fact that we've been set back so far by incompetent, vicious, foolish leadership, we will have the four greatest years in the history of our country. [cheers and applause]
And with your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight.
CROWD: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
TRUMP: We have to get out and vote. We have to win, win, win. We got to win, win, win. If you don't win, win, win, we've all had a good time, but it's not going to matter, right? Sadly. Because what we've done is amazing. Three nominations in a row, what we've done, we got to win. If we don't win, it's like it was all for not very much. We can't let that happen.
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you, Georgia. God bless you. God bless you, Georgia. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. God bless you all. [cheers and applause]

    JIM GAFFIGAN: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to bring up a man who loves New York City, he is the Republican nominee and the 45th President of United States, President Donald J. Trump. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you, everybody. Well, thank you very much. It's an honor.
And they told me under no circumstances are you allowed to use a teleprompter, and I got up here and I see there's this beautiful teleprompter. So here I am.
But it is a tremendous thing. It's a tremendous dinner. I've come here with my father. So it was three times, but it was also many times before that, a long time ago. And it's a very special dinner. And you've done a fantastic job, Cardinal. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. [cheers and applause]
So I'd like to thank, your eminence, very much and members of the clergy. So many people I know. Speaker of the House, Johnson, what a job you're doing. He has done a great job. [cheers and applause]
Senator Schumer, good. I supported him. [cheers and applause] I was, oh, I don't know. I don't know. He used to say that's true and now I'm not sure he would. But I gave him his first check from an office in Beech Haven and I was very proud of it. I don't know about it lately. No, I was, I was. It was his first check. He was running and I said, ""He's a good man.""
Senator Gillibrand, thank you very much. Thank you very much for working hard. [cheers and applause]
Governor Hochul, wherever you may be, this is a big dais, right? Where is the Governor? Good job. It's not an easy one, is it? But you're doing all right. We have to get a little money from the federal government. I have to tell you. [laughter] It's about time. It's about time. Mayor Adams, good luck with everything. [laughter] They went after you. They went after you, mayor.
Yeah, boy. I knew that. Nine and a half months ago, I said—And he just said something bad about the administration. He's going to be indicted any moment. [laughter] And guess what happened—But you're going to win. I think you're going to win. I know you're going to win. So good luck. Good luck. I don't like what they do. I don't like what they do. And also distinguished—I've got so many friends up here. It's uh great. Lot a great friends. Some of my best friends. And you are right, they are distinguished and they are wealthy for the most part. A couple are having a hard time, but they're going to get over it. [laughter]
I also want to thank my very beautiful wife and thank you for mentioning, but can you believe that she did a book? And it's a really good book and she worked hard on it, and it just became number one on the New York Times list, so I think that's okay. [cheers and applause] That's not an easy thing to do, especially when your name is Trump and you're on the New York Times list. That thing, that must be selling like hotcakes. But thank you for mentioning, I appreciate it. Good job, you did.
It's a true pleasure to be with you this evening. Amazing pleasure. And these days, it's uh really a pleasure. Anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance. [laughter] Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy. They've gone after me, Mr. Mayor. You're peanuts compared to what they've done to me. [laughter] And you're going to be okay. But I have to be careful, however, to understand that this will be the first time in the history of this event where jokes will be fact-checked and they will be. And they will be. It's been a long tradition for both Democrat and Republican candidates for president of the United States to attend this dinner.
Always, it's a rule. You got to go to the dinner. You got to do it, otherwise, bad things are going to happen to you from up there. [laughter] You can't do what I just saw on that screen, but my opponent feels like she does not have to be here, which is deeply disrespectful to the event and in particular to our great Catholic community, very disrespectful. [cheers and applause]
The last Democrat not to attend this important event was Walter Mondale, and it did not go very well for him. [laughter] He lost 49 states and he won one, Minnesota. So I said, there's no way I'm missing it. Actually, it was not easy for me to get here tonight. Cardinal, I wasn't going to miss this thing. No matter, I didn't care. I wasn't going to miss it. But that's true. Walter Mondale, 49 and one. He was expected to do well and it didn't work out. [laughter]
It shows you there is a God, I mean, for those people that are questioning. [laughter] I understand the real reason that she's not here is she's hunting with her running mate, spending a lot of time hunting. [laughter] In any event, it's a weird, weird, weird, weird—You know the word weird? They call me weird. They call JD weird. We're very solid people.
This guy is calling us weird. But this was weird that the Democrat candidate is not here and with us tonight. I want to also congratulate somebody who's going to make us all healthy. RFK Jr. we love you. [cheers and applause] I don't see him. He's campaigning all over the place. He's campaigning. You're all over.
Hello, you both. Nice to see you both. You're doing a good job. He's a great guy too. He really is. He's going to make us a healthier place. We're going to let him go wild for a little while. Then I'm going to have to maybe rein him back. [laughter] He's got some pretty wild ideas, but most of them are really good, I think. He's a good man and he believes the environment. The healthy people. He wants healthy people. He wants healthy food and he's going to do it. He's going to have a big chance to do it because we do need that.
I would not have missed the Al Smith dinner for anything in the world. I still remember coming here as a very young guy with my father, Fred. He was a great guy, my father. He was a tough cookie, but he had a very big heart. Anytime we'd walk down the street—And you don't see it too much anymore. There'd be people standing with tin cans, tin cans, and he would always take out $100 and put it in that can. And I always thought it was beautiful. And frankly, I even think more so now it was beautiful because nowadays you don't see it so much.
But I miss him. And we used to come here very religiously. And a great New York tradition has been born 79 years ago. It was born 79 years ago. And there are some people that were here for almost at length. I know many of them and it's not a pretty picture. [laughter] It's not a pretty picture.
The two candidates for president are supposed to exchange good-natured barbs, and we get along very well. I didn't like Biden very much, and now I like him quite a bit. [laughter]
Now I say that she's much worse than him. He was a much better candidate than her actually. And when we hopefully win, dispose of her, I like her a lot, but right now I can't stand her. It's true. [laughter] I can't stand her. I've never liked people that I was competing against. When you do, a lot of bad things happen.
And we are doing well by the way. The votes are starting to come in. You got to get out and vote. And Catholics, you got to vote for me. [cheers] Just remember. You better remember, I'm here and she's not. I could have done that too.
But you do something that's incredible. The Catholic church, you're helping the poor, educating children and supporting the vulnerable. But if you really wanted Vice President Harris to accept your invitation, I guess you should have told her the funds were going to bail out the looters and rioters in Minneapolis and she would've been here guaranteed. [cheers] She would've been here. Guaranteed.
She would've been okay. She would've been okay with that. But I know this isn't my normal crowd tonight because it just isn't. It's not my normal crowd. Believe me, my normal crowd is younger, has a lot more energy. [laughter] But you have certain advantages too, like cash, lots of cash. [laughter] But many of you're Manhattan liberals from the media and the Democrat Party. I always say the Democrat. You know—[Trump points to Chuck Schumer] Chuck doesn't like that. He likes Democratic and it sounds much more beautiful. The Democratic Party. I always say the Democrat Party, because it sounds worse. [laughter]
It's true. He likes Democratic. Why don't they just change the name this way? You know, it is Democrat. But I must say I was shocked when I heard that Kamala was skipping the Al Smith dinner. I'd really hoped that she would come because we can't get enough of hearing her beautiful laugh. She laughs like crazy. [laughter] We would recognize it any place in this room.
And all polls are indicating I'm leading big with the Catholic vote, as I should be, as I should be. But I don't think Kamala has given up yet. She hasn't. Instead of attending tonight, she's in Michigan receiving communion from Gretchen Whitmer. [laughter]
That's not a pretty sight. But Catholics, please don't be too insulted by Kamala's absence.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible]
TRUMP: If the Democrats—Thank you very much. I appreciate that. [laughter]
If Democrats really wanted to have someone not be with us this evening, they would've just sent Joe Biden. [laughter] You know he's having second thoughts, you know that, right? He wants to come back. If she does any worse than the polls, they're going to bring him back again.
I think, Chuck, he's going to do it. He's the one that got him out. That's the guy.
Much more so than crazy Nancy, I will tell you because I know him. He did it.
Joe has almost disappeared from view. The only way he could be seen less is if he had a show on CNN. They had nothing. [laughter] They've got nothing. Fake news, right? Fake. That term wasn't good. They say that term is no longer [inaudible] because it's much worse than fake. I don't want to tell you what the real name is. I won't do it because all those cameras would shut off immediately. They don't like that.
But apparently Joe didn't think it was fair for me to have the podium to myself with Kamala skipping the event. So he called, looked at me and said, ""Don't."" Does anybody understand that? [laughter] Yes.
I thought it was actually very good until just now. [laughter]
It was announced this morning that at a funeral yesterday, in a rare moment of clarity. Joe told Barack Hussein Obama, they quote—Only a few people got that. Or as Rush Limbaugh used to say, ""Barack Hussein Obama."" Remember him? He was a piece of work. We miss him. [laughter]
But as he told Barack Hussein Obama quote, ""She's not as strong as me. She's not as strong. Do you understand that?"" And Obama agreed saying, ""That's true. Other than that, I think the Democrats are getting along quite well.""
Right?—
Okay, nobody got that one. [laughter]
The fact is, we need new leadership in this country right now. We have someone in the White House who can barely talk, barely put together two coherent sentences, who seems to have mental faculties of a child. It's sad. He's a person that has nothing going. No intelligence whatsoever. But enough about Kamala Harris. [laughter] Let's get onto something.
I know Kamala's word because she spends a lot of time complaining. I won't agree to another debate. But the truth is, I've debated twice this year once against Joe Biden and once against David Muir of ABC. [laughter] That was amazing. 11 times. None for the other side. Do you think that's fair news? I don't think so. That's fake news. I don't know what's going to happen three weeks from now. It's going to be very interesting. It just started.
Its actually uh—its actually—isn't it sort of exciting, right? It really is. Isn't just exciting what's going on? It's a process. It's a rough process too. Not so pretty and yet sometimes very beautiful.
But the press is reporting the Democrats are starting to panic. They're panicking. They are panicking because you know the votes that are coming and are coming in very, very strong a certain way. I won't tell you what way that is, but Chuck Schumer is here looking very glum. Doesn't he look glum? He looks glum.
CHUCK SCHUMER: [shaking head] No I'm not [laughter]
TRUMP: But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president.[laughter]
And actually, I said, ""Do you mind if I do that?"" He said, ""No, you got to do what you got to do. He's a pro. He's a professional."" No, he's a good man actually. I hate to say it. [laughter] Don't ever use it against me, please. They'll say, ""This dinner was really setting me back when I say it now."" But I've known him a long time.
There's a group called White Dudes for Harris. Have you seen this? White Dudes for Harris? Anybody know? Are some of you here? White Dudes for Harris? Doesn't sound like it. [laughter]
But I'm not worried about them at all because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me. [laughter] Every one of those people are voting for me.
And as you may have seen, Kamala did an interview on Fox News yesterday. It went so poorly for her that the Democrats have been forced to install another 100 drop boxes throughout the city. [laughter]
And the upside really is Kamala now sees the benefit of deportation. She wants to deport people. She's vicious. She wants to deport people and she wants to start by deporting Bret Baier of Fox. It's an interesting interview last night.
A major issue in this race is child care. And Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don't like it. The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband, Doug, anywhere near the nannies. Just keep them away.
That's a nasty one. That's nasty.
I told these idiots that gave me this stuff, that's too tough. [laughter]
Oh, they told me the last time I did this, I was running against Crooked Hillary and—I mean, Hillary. I was running against Crooked Hillary and I did it, and I thought it was a roast. So I was told it's a roast. And I had the meanest guy you've ever seen write stuff up and man, was the room angry. Even the Cardinal remembers. I went overboard.
Don't you agree, Cardinal? It was like terrible.
And I knew I was in trouble around midway through because people had— you know even my own side was angry at me. They were saying, ""It's too much."" But uh I did it anyway. I didn't give a damn. [laughter]
Campaigning could take a toll on a family and family life. Although I hear that Kamala and her husband carve out some really beautiful alone time at the end of the day for an intimate dinner. Just Doug, her and the teleprompter that she uses quite well.
And by the way, she wouldn't have liked this tonight if she was told about no teleprompter. I can't believe I saw a teleprompter. They said they've never had a teleprompter in the history of this dinner. I told that to the Cardinal, right?
And then a teleprompter pops up for—He must be a very important comedian to get that. They give you one, but not me. How about that one? Come here. [Trump shakes hands with Jim Gaffigan] And you did a good job.
Tradition holds that I'm supposed to tell a few self-deprecating jokes this evening. So here it goes—
Nope, I've got nothing. [laughter]
I've got nothing. [cheers and applause]
There's nothing to say.
I guess I just don't see the point of taking shots at myself when other people have been shooting at me for a hell of a long time and they shoot.
You know they say about presidents, they say that Andrew Jackson was the president that was the most meanly treated. His wife died. She died of heartache. She was heartbroken at the way they treated him. And they say that second was Abraham Lincoln, but he was in charge of a civil war you know.
But those were the two, Andrew Jackson—Up until me. Now they say it's not even close. There's never been a president that's been treated so badly as me and our people aren't happy about it. But I was treated a little bit rough, but I don't mind it somehow and I think it's just part of the game.
I'd like to thank our emcee this evening, Jim Gaffigan. Most recently Jim has been playing Tim Walz on Saturday Night Live, and that'll be a very short gig, I hope, Jim. [laughter]
But it was fun while it lasted, wasn't it? Let's see how that lasts, right? It better be quick. We don't want Tim, and I'm not going to say anymore. But unfortunately Governor Walz isn't here himself. But don't worry, he'll say that he was. [laughter]
He's going to say—I used to think that Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods, but then I met Tim Walz. [laughter]
The stupid show, The View is so bad now that the other day I was watching it and thinking to myself, you know what? They really need to bring Rosie O'Donnell back. [laughter] That show is bad. Those people are bad. I know every one of them and they are bad news, I want to tell you. And it doesn't do very well either. I always like to say—you know ratings are very important. When they don't do well, it doesn't do very well. As I look around the dais, I see all of the usual suspects.
For instance, Mayor Adams. I'd like to poke some fun at Eric, but I'm going to be nice. I just want to be nice because I know what it's like to be persecuted by the DOJ for speaking out against open borders. [applause]
We were persecuted, Eric. I was persecuted and so are you, Eric. The Mayor's dietary restrictions are well known, but I've got to say I've never met a person who's a vegan who liked turkey so much. There's something about him with turkey, I just found that out today. And you know, I haven't been in New York that much. Don't let it—But, you're going to win, Eric.
We have another former New York City mayor with us, frankly, easily the worst in our history. [laughter]
And it's not Michael, that I can tell you. I'm surprised that Bill de Blasio was actually able to make it tonight, to be honest. He was a terrible mayor. I don't give a shit if this is comedy or not. [cheers and applause] He was a terrible mayor. He did a horrible job. That's not comedy, by the way. That's fact. [laughter]
But unlike the rest of New York, at least Bill doesn't have to worry about the criminals. They owe him big. He let them get away with a lot of stuff. Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick. Especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas. That's right. They've reserved many rooms, many rooms, a lot of rooms, too many rooms.
But in all seriousness, it's an honor to be here to support the city and the community. It's a great community that I love. I've been here a long time and I love it. And that it's going to make a big comeback, and I'm going to help it make a comeback. I'm going to win and I'm going to make a comeback. We're going to turn this thing around. [cheers and applause]
And I want to pay tribute to a really incredible man, a man who was a tremendous politician and actually the fact that he was Catholic, was, it probably did him in. Nobody knows for sure, but uh he was a great guy. Al Smith, great guy. Everyone says it. Happy warrior.
I've said before that, I'll say it again, I'll say it again as many times as I have to directly to the Mayor and the Governor, if I have the honor to be elected next month—We're going to see what happens. It's happening so fast. But if I have the honor, I look forward to working together to make this city greater than ever before. We're going to do that. [applause]
We're going to be focused on our work with the governor. I'll work with the Mayor. Democrats, I will work with them. I work with whoever I have to, and we will even work very hard to bring back the SALT tax deduction. We're going to bring it back. We're going to bring it back. We're going to get that thing going, Chuck. Okay?
I actually thought about not doing jokes tonight. I was going to come out here and say, listen, our country is doing very badly. This is not about jokes. And then some person said, you have to do jokes. I said, I don't want to. There's nothing funny about what's happening to our country. And I actually meant that I was going to do that, but they convinced me to say some of the things I said tonight.
I don't know if they were funny or not. But hey, you think this is easy standing up here and doing this in front of half a room that hates my guts and the other half loves me. Half of us love me—Well, maybe it's I think 75% love me.
But I actually though I did think about that, and our country is doing very badly with respect to its open borders and inflation crushing, things happening in the Middle East and Ukraine. It's so sad to see what's happening in Ukraine. Wow. I had a lot of people, from—very religious people come up to me tonight from Ukraine, and they're asking me for help. So sad to see so many people have been killed in Ukraine and we're going to get it settled up if we win.
As I'm President-elect, I'm going to get that done. I'm going to do it before we ever get—We have to get it stopped. Too much killing. It's killing. And all of those cities are coming crashing down. Those beautiful golden domes are crashing down on their sides.
They're—so sad to see. The whole thing is so sad. So we're going to be—For all those people, there's so many people came up to the dais and religious people from Ukraine and I'm gonna say—I told them, don't worry, we're going to get it stopped. It's too bad it ever started. It should have never started. It wouldn't have started. But uh we're going to have our country respected again. We're going to make sure that it's respected and we're going to go out and do very good things for ourselves as a country and for the world.
These are challenging times for our beautiful USA. But I'm committed to working with every partner here in New York and all across the nation to build an America that once again is strong and safe and proud and prosperous and free. I'm going to make sure.
Together we can create a future defined by great ambitions and grand achievements that once again inspires the dreams of our children, brings back the American dream. You don't hear about the American dream anymore. We're going to make it possible for them to have the American dream. This is a very religious evening to me, it really is. It represents so much.
My sister was somebody that loved the church and gave to the church. The cardinal knew that. Had a certain priest that she thought was incredible, right? A certain, very fine man that she thought was incredible.
Having recently myself survived two assassination attempts, I survived. I have a chart that went down to the right, fortunately I looked, it's my all-time favorite piece of paper.
But it went down and I looked to the right and I said, you know, was that luck? Was that luck or was that God that did that? And I think it was God that did that. I do. I do. [cheers and applause]
But I have a very fresh—Cardinal, I have a very fresh appreciation for how blessed we are by God's providence and his divine mercy. I mean, that was something I was not supposed to be here tonight that I can tell you. So with God's help, I know there is nothing that cannot be achieved.
We can achieve so much good with this country and get together and unify.
I want to thank the Al Smith Foundation for its noble work, and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic community. It's a great community. It's a community I've gotten along with all my life. I'll tell you, when I was, when I was president I was in the Oval Office that I got a call from the Cardinal and he said, we need help.
It was during the China virus, I want to be accurate when I describe it. [laughter]
And he said, we need help. Our schools are in devastating shape. They needed much more than a billion. I won't even tell you the number. But much more than a billion dollars. But I've known the community and I've known the schools. I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great, and they just speak with it with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen. And he said, sir, we have a big problem. We need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York School System, the whole system in New York. And I said, give me 15 minutes. I think I can find it. And we gave him billions of dollars. And you know what? He stayed open and they thrived. And to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education. [applause]
And that was always an honor. And every time he sees me, he says, thank you very much. I said, I know what you're talking about. But we worked together. We were a good partnership. We got that money in about 15 minutes, billions, and uh it was put to very good use.
But I just want to thank everybody. This is a special evening. It's a very serious evening, I think. We have some serious problems in the world, but they're going to get solved and we're going to make America great again.
And thank you very much.
And God bless you all. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

TRUMP: Thank you everybody. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you very much.
And a very, very special, we love this place. We love Detroit. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
And hello to Michigan. We win Michigan, we win the whole ballgame. Thank you very much. I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands and thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. Thank you very much, everybody.
So I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: No. [booing]
TRUMP: Not even close, and our country's not better off, that I can tell you. Early mail-in voting in Michigan is now underway. So here in Detroit, early in-person, voting starts tomorrow, so get the hell out and vote. You got to get out and vote. With your help, 18 days from now, we are going to win the state of Michigan. We are going to defeat Kamala Harris, [cheers and applause] and we are going to quite simply make America great again. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause]
You know, Detroit has such great potential, but Kamala and the Democrats have been wreaking havoc on this place, this very, very—In many respects, it's a sacred place. So many things happened in Detroit and it's been treated so badly. And they've been talking about comebacks for so long, but we're going to bring it back better than it ever was, better than it was many, many years ago. [cheers and applause]
We're going to make Detroit great again. We're going to make it great again. They have been talking about it for years and years and years. For generations, this city and state where the world capital of automotive production and one of the great manufacturing centers in all of history. No matter where you went, this was the greatest in all of history.
But year after year, globalist politicians like Crooked Joe Biden— [booing] —Lying Kamala Harris— [booing] —Sold you out and let other countries loot, pillage, and plunder our wealth, our jobs, and our dreams. And they did that here more than any other place in our country. 40% of Michigan auto jobs were annihilated after NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization was a disaster for your beautiful place, your beautiful city, and frankly your beautiful state. Detroit was decimated. [booing] That's right. Detroit was decimated as if by a foreign army. It was no difference. Our factories were left in ruins. And under Kamala Harris, this year alone, the United States has lost nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, they're doing a terrible job. [booing]
Did you see her interview the other night? She said, ""Essentially I'd keep it the way Biden had it."" That's great, that's great. He got out because of the way he kept it. She'll keep it the same way.
U.S. car sales are down 38% since I left office. But with victory in November, we're going to take back what is ours. And it is ours. We're going to take it back. We're going to bring back our jobs, our dignity, and our dreams. [cheers and applause]
And standing before you tonight, I am proclaiming to the people of this state that by the end of my term, the entire world will be talking about the Michigan miracle and the stunning rebirth of Detroit. [cheers and applause]
And this will be a real rebirth.
Under the Trump administration all who have robbed you, raided you, ransacked you, and abused you will discover very quickly, America will not be taken advantage of anymore. We were taken advantage of for years, for decades. [cheers] We will reclaim our stolen wealth, and the days of Detroit's economic glory will return greater and stronger than ever before. Promise. [cheers and applause]
And I know how to do it. Oh, do I know how to do it—I will put Detroit first, I will put Michigan first, and I will put America first. And that's the way it is. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA, USA, USA, USA, USA!
TRUMP: As we speak, China was building a gigantic auto plant in Mexico. You know about that. And really more than one. [booing] Don't worry about it. I took care of it for you, took care of it. It's already done without even closing the big deal, which is the presidency. I've already got it done.
Of course, if she got in, she has no idea what the hell she's doing. She's grossly incompetent, worse than him. Then I cannot tell you what's going to—I can tell you. They'll build the plant. I can tell you. But it's already done. They think they're going to sell all of their cars into the United States and destroy Michigan. But it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. I promise you. [cheers and applause]
Now they're building giant plants, and now they just announced something which is going to save Detroit. Because you would not be able to compete with this plant, the biggest in the world by far. Friend of mine builds them. He said the biggest in the world. He wanted to show it to me. I said, ""No, thank you. I have other things to do."" I want to see the plants built in the United States. That's the ones I want to look at.
So I said to him, ""John,"" a year ago, ""I want to see a plant."" And he said, ""Sir, we'll have to go to Mexico."" I said, ""I don't want to go to Mexico. I want to look at one here."" I said, ""There's no big ones being built in the United States."" I said, ""That's bad."" I said, ""How big is it in Mexico? The biggest in the world?"" I said, ""So they're going to make cars and sell them in here."" Kill Detroit, kill Michigan. You wouldn't have anything left. [booing] You wouldn't have anything left. [booing] So the other day I was speaking—A couple of weeks ago, I was speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit, which was nice. Made a nice speech. And what happened?
I saw John, who's the biggest and the best auto builder. That's what he does. He builds plants. I don't know if he can build anything else. I'm not sure he can build an apartment, but plants he's very good at. And I hadn't spoken to him in a year. He was telling me about this massive plant. And I spoke and I explained how I'm going to put massive tariffs, very big tariffs on anybody in Mexico that's selling cars that are going to hurt our business here. And I said to him, ""How's that plant coming along, John?"" And he said, ""Sir, they just told me it's over. They're not building it. They think Trump is going to win. He's going to impose tariffs and it's worthless."" [cheers and applause]
You owe me big. You owe me. You owe me. So they stopped construction. They're not building it. And Detroit will survive. But now we got to make it more. Now we're going to build the plants. So I'm going to do, sometime next week, I'm going to call the people building the plant. Very big wealthy company. It's backed by China. It's China, you know? It's China. It's in Mexico, but it's China. And I'm going to say, ""Build your plant in the United States."" We want people to build plants in the United States, employ our people. That's what we want. And if you do that, it's a whole different story. And ideally they'll build it right here in Detroit. [cheers and applause] And we'll get Detroit moving, and others will come also.
So vote Trump, and you'll see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights, and from Beijing to right here in Detroit and other cities all across America. Because a strong auto industry will make all of Detroit richer, boosting suppliers, real estate, and your entire economy. And you know I've been reading. Seriously, I've been reading about Detroit for so long, the comeback. This is the real comeback. This isn't artificial stuff. This is the real comeback. [cheers and applause]
You better vote for me. So very simply—It's not overly complex. Some people don't understand it. If you watched Bloomberg the other day, you would've seen the CEO of Bloomberg interview me, and I think he understood it. And I think the Wall Street Journal now understands it. Because to me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary—It's not love, it's not respect—[Trump's microphone cuts out at 10:37. He paces the stage and waits for a fix, occasionally trying the mic, until 28:46 when the microphone begins working again. The crowd chants repeatedly, and Trump occasionally tries the mic again.]
CROWD: Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
We want Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump—
TRUMP: [muted] Can you hear me? Can you hear me? [inaudible]
CROWD: We love Trump, We love Trump, We love Trump
Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump—
One! Two! Three! Trump! One! Two! Three! Trump!
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight—
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA—
Thank you Trump! Thank you Trump!
[audio is restored]
TRUMP: Hello—[cheers and applause] [walks around stage]
Well, thank you everybody. Thank you. So now what happens is I won't pay the bill for this stupid company that rented us this track. [cheers and applause] I won't pay the bill and then we'll have a story that Trump didn't pay the bill to a contractor. No, when they do the kind of a job, don't pay the bill. That's terrible.
They also had a little problem with energy coming into the building, but I'm not blaming it on that. But here is my plan. Do we have fun? [cheers and applause] And can everybody hear perfectly now?
CROWD: Yeah [cheering].
TRUMP: I don't like the mic anyway. I didn't like it from the minute I started. And this is important because we're doing things here that are really going to be amazing. So let me know and if it goes out again, I'll sue the ass off that company. [cheers and applause] We're going to sue him. Then they'll say what a horrible guy Trump is. He's a terrible guy.
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, the free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. That's us. But only if they make their products here in America and hire American workers for the job. [cheers and applause]
And if these companies don't make their cars and products here, then they will pay a tariff. A very stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We're going to protect our companies. We're not going to let them steal our companies like they have in the past. We're going to call this policy Build it in America Plan. Because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple. Build it in America. Very simple.
And to be specific, build it in Detroit and we'll give you good electricity. [cheers and applause] Or build it in Dearborn, or Lansing, or Grand Rapids, or Flint. Flint.
The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made in America corporate tax rate. So we brought the rate down and you saw this from close to 40% to 21% and you've already had that. Nobody thought it could be done. We got it down to 21. Now we're going to get it down to 15%, but only if they build it in America. Does that make sense? [cheers and applause]
And for those who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay tariffs and we will take in hundreds of billions of dollars toward our budget. We'll pay down our debt. We'll reduce your taxes still further. I give you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and we will take in so much money and we will take in so many jobs and we will be bringing for the first time in years and years and decades, companies will be coming to us and they'll be coming back to Detroit and they'll love it. [cheers and applause]
Some say my defense of American Jobs makes me a protectionist. And yes, I will protect what is ours. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs and I will protect our borders. I will protect our families and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. [cheers and applause]
These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons, and it's not protectionist, it's pro-worker. It's really not protectionist. We've had people ripping our country for years, decades destroying. You look outside, you see all the hulks, you see the empty buildings. For years and years they've been ripping us off. Now it's time for us to get it back. We're going to get it all back. [cheers and applause]
These pro-worker policies are among the many reasons why I've been overwhelmingly endorsed by the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters, including 62% of the Teamster members and there are a lot of them here today. Stand up please. Teamsters, we love you. Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.
Kamala does not even pretend to have a plan to save Detroit because she knows her agenda will reduce your future to rubble. He's not going to—Her plan will drive every company, even small businesses out of our country or out of business. It's a disaster. It is a disaster. [booing]
Kamala's inflation has already cost a typical family over $30,000 in higher prices and now she's proposing to raise the typical family's taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. So watch these two videos. Let's see if they have some electricity going to them please. And it would be nice if the television cameras could watch them also because they don't do that.
[shows video montage]
CLIP: [TAX CUTS AND INCREASES]
COMMENTATOR 1: Mr. President, there are many different tax policies which could cripple the economy. But the first thing she wants to do is allow these Trump tax cuts to expire.
COMMENTATOR 2: Even the New York Times admits that 85% of the middle class got a tax cut.
COMMENTATOR 3: Americans will face a hike. The tax foundation, finding that a couple with two kids making $165,000 a year would have to pay over $2,400 more in taxes.
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to work to get rid of that tax cut. Joe and I are about to get rid of that tax bill. Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that tax cut.
COMMENTATOR 4: Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate.
HARRIS: I think that's fantastic. We've got to increase the corporate tax rate. Part of that is going to be about repealing that tax bill that they just passed, and also looking at estate taxes are going to have to go up. We will tax capital gains. But we're going to have to raise corporate taxes.
[crosstalk among unnamed commentators]: Taxing unrealized gains just doesn't seem fair in any sense of the word.
Because you're paying for schools.
When the value of your home goes up, you pay higher taxes even if you don't sell your home.
It's tiring.
Your value of your home never moves the way the stock moves to say, ""We're going to tax what you don't have."" That's a sore point and it's a big deal. Is that something you think she firmly believes in?
I think it's part of the proposals of the campaign.
HARRIS: Under my plan, there will also be a carbon fee. There has to be some connection between the fee and bad behaviors, and there has to be, in that we have to monitor whether it's going to be passed on to consumers. But I'm going to tell you that should never be the reason not to actually put a fee, and in particular a carbon fee. [booing]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
This is the worst mic I've ever had in my life. [laughter]
This is the worst.
The tax queen is also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike on all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in the history of our country. In other words, she's going to tax your companies and you out of business. The companies are going to leave and you're going to end up with the same message you've had for the last 40 years. In total, our proposals are estimated to kill almost a million full-time jobs under Kamala, who knows absolutely nothing about what we're doing. It will be economic Armageddon for Detroit.
You go back further—Very simply, we're going to make it great. We're going to make it so good. You're going to have jobs coming in like never before. [cheers and applause]
Under Trump we'll turn this city into the most powerful jobs magnet in the history of the world. Upon taking office, I will immediately begin to eliminate every job killing regulation in the books. We eliminated more than any other President in four years. There's never been a President that eliminated more times five.
As a senator—Kalam[sic]—Ugh, this one here, Kamala. You know I'd like to call her Harris, but nobody knows who the hell I'm talking about. [laughter] You ever see that? Like you say Harris, ""Who the hell is Harris?""
As a senator, Kamala voted to impose a 100% ban on gas powered cars and trucks, which would kill an estimated 200,000 U.S. auto jobs. [booing]
On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the green news scam once and for all. [cheers and applause] We will quickly become energy independent and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill baby drill. [cheers and applause]
I will cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. So listen, I will cut your energy prices in half, 50%, 5-0. Cut them in half within 12 months of taking office. That's going to bring everything down. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small business and we will also have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. [cheers and applause]
I will make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. And we will—They will be so—listen to that. What will that do for the cars? Fully tax-deductible interest on a car. You buy a car and you get a deduction. Wall Street called me up. They said, ""How the hell did you think of that idea?"" That's a good one because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream and you're going to have the American dream. Finally, I haven't had it in 50 years.
Working with Elon Musk—Is he good or what? [cheers and applause] I saw that rocket come down three, four days ago. That sucker was coming down. I said, ""Oh my God, I never saw anything like it."" I was on the phone with a friend. I'm talking about something. I don't know, something maybe having to do with Detroit. Could that be possible?
But I'm talking on the phone and I see the screen is on and no sound. And I'm saying, ""Wait a minute, I have to put the phone down. I don't believe what I'm seeing."" And I saw that big monster coming down that big—It's like a twenty-story building or something coming down. The engines are glowing and they're firing and spitting. And I said, ""It's going to crash. It's going to crash into the gantry, don't crash."" And then you see another engine take it perfectly and lands right at the spot that it took off. I said, ""That must be Elon. He's nailed it. [cheers and applause]
Nobody else."" It must be Elon. So I called up Elon. I said, ""Elon, was that you?"" He goes, ""That was me."" I said, ""Who else can do it?."" ""Nobody."" I said, ""Can Russia do it?"" ""No."" ""Can the U.S. do it? Meaning the U.S. outside of you?"" He said, ""No, nobody can do that."" I said, ""You're the coolest. That's pretty."" And he endorsed me long time ago actually saying It's the most important election we've ever had. [cheers and applause]
But working with Elon Musk, we will cut trillions of dollars in government waste. He's very good at that. He knows better than anybody. It won't affect anybody other than it'll look awfully good and it'll help bring our country back. I want to thank also Elon for campaigning so hard in Pennsylvania. Do you know he actually feels this? Can you imagine? He just lands his biggest landing anyone's ever seen and he leaves for Pennsylvania to campaign for me. Can you imagine that? [cheers and applause]
And he also, and we got to say this. I went to North Carolina, which really was hit hard. Georgia too, really hit hard. But in North Carolina they had no communications. It was like they were an island unto themselves. And I said to the people, ""What can we do?"" He said, ""We have no communication. People are dying. It's a mess."" They said, ""The federal government, Washington is doing a terrible job. Sir, do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""I happen to know him. He endorsed me. What's the problem?"" He said, ""Can you get Starlink?"" I said, ""What the hell is Starlink?"" [laughter] And they explained it to me. I'm a fast study. It didn't take too long. So I called up Elon and I was saying, ""Elon, we're in North Carolina. The people are really—It's devastation here. It's unbelievable. They have no communication to the mainland. It's like it cut it off. It's incredible. The water was never—We've never seen anything like that.""
I said, ""Elon, Starlink."" It's very hard to get by the way, because it's very successful, very hard to get. I said, ""Can you get Starlink, a lot of those suckers? Can you get them for North Carolina and parts of Georgia?"" And I was talking to him about it and all of a sudden I get a call in the other line. It's the man from North Carolina. ""Thank you sir, for getting the Starlink."" I said, ""I haven't even finished my conversation."" Now think of that. [cheers and applause]
I said, ""Elon, I haven't even finished my conversation. And they're already saying, you sent."" ""That's right. I did that. I do two things at one time. I can do that."" So he's great. He saved a lot of lives, I think, and he really—And by the way, the Starlink worked perfectly. As soon as he got there was perfect. So thank you to Elon for that he did a great job. [cheers and applause]
And if we do all of this, our flag will fly proudly once more over the gleaming new factories and the whole world will witness Michigan's resurgence. Wealth will flood into our country and into the hands of our great workers. And that is the future that awaits for Detroit under a certain gentleman named President—President Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? [cheers and applause]
It's going to be real. It's going to be real. As we rebuild our economy, we'll also restore our borders. Did you ever see anything like what's coming through our borders? Criminals, drug dealers, prisoners, people from mental institutions. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, insane asylums, and mental institutions all around the world from Venezuela to the Congo, and she's resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. I happen to think it's the worst thing that's happened. I think it's worse than inflation. I think it's worse than a bad economy. I think it's the worst thing that happened to us. [cheers and applause]
21 million people. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. I have no choice. [cheers and applause]
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country—Or to say it a little differently, Kamala, but I don't give a damn if I pronounce it right. Who the hell can pronounce—? It's the savage Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua. Do you know them? It's a very nice group of young gentlemen, very fine people. There were gang members in Venezuela. We let them into our country. By the way, they're taking over parts of cities all over the place. But in Aurora, Colorado, and communities in all 50 states, this gang is terrorizing law-abiding citizens, including taking over multiple apartment complexes. This, you have to take a look at this. Take a look.
[shows video montage]
CLIP: [OPEN BORDERS, DEADLY CONSEQUENCES.]
COMMENTATOR 1: Open borders, deadly consequences.
COMMENTATOR 2: Border crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.
COMMENTATOR 3: It's a full-blown invasion.

TRUMP: Just so you know, we have the most dangerous criminals in the world in our country now. We never had anything like this. These are the most dangerous criminals in the world. They make our criminals look like very nice people. That's about the only thing you can say.
But they are the worst among the worst people and they come from all over the world. I thought it was 158 countries. Last week, they reported it's 181 countries. They're coming from all over the world. They're emptying their prisons into our country, mental institutions, into our country, and they're taking their street gangs, and their drug dealers, and terrorists are now in our country. 21 million people came in under their rule and she was in charge of the border. She's a grossly incompetent person and we can't let this happen. We have to get the hell out and vote and get them out of here. [cheers and applause]
The United States is now an occupied country. How about that? Do you ever think you'd be hearing that? We're an occupied country. We're being occupied.
You know, if you have a million person army, that's a big army. They've got millions and millions of people. If they just take a small percentage of them, they'd have six million-man or woman army. Think of that.
They've let these people into our country, they're emptying out the jails all over the world, the mental institutions all over the world, they're coming in. I think it's the biggest problem we have. I don't care. Deflation and inflation, it's all bad stuff, but this is—The polls say the biggest problem is our economy, which stinks. The second-biggest problem is inflation, which is devastate—worst we've ever had. And the third is our border. I think the border is the first biggest problem—[mumbling]its one of the three.
But November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America. [cheers and applause]
And when I get rid of this microphone at the end of the speech, it's going to be Liberation Day for Donald J. Trump because I'm blowing out my voice to get this sucker done. I'm blowing out my voice. But I'm going to get through this speech because you're from Detroit. We're going to turn this place around. We're going to make sure that electric current comes into it like it should.
Liberation of Donald Trump. Good night, folks. That'll be—That's terrible.
But I think it's okay. I mean, you can hear it. If I scream like hell into the mic, I think good for you, not so good for me. But that's okay. That's what my life has been about for the last 10 years. And that's good because we love you. We're going to turn it all around for you.
Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal aliens, convicted murderers are on the loose in the United States. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I have no choice. We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
I will rescue every town across America that's been invaded and conquered, and I will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country, which is my number one choice. [cheers and applause]
To expedite removals of the Tren de Aragua gangs and other savage gangs like MS-13, which is just as bad. We have by the thousands now. I took them out by the thousands and they now are coming back in by the thousands. These people, what they've done to our country, I can't even believe it. I can't even believe it.
I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that's where we had to go, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. We will call it Operation Aurora. We want to pay tribute to Aurora, Colorado. The governor there is a radical left Democrat. He is petrified. The guy just don't want to walk out of his mansion. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So we keep them out. [cheers and applause]
And I am hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Kamala's migrant invasion is also devastating our great African-American community, stealing American jobs, crushing wages, undercutting the voting power of our own citizens, and bringing drugs, crime, and death to our country. You know, we're devastating the African-American population, they're taking their jobs. It's terrible. It's terrible. And also Hispanic, they're taking a lot of Hispanic jobs. And the jobs created by Biden are all being taken by people coming into the country illegally. So you know, it's terrible. Yet Kamala says there is nothing she would do differently. Listen to this, she'll do nothing differently.
[shows video montage]
CLIP: [WOULD YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DIFFERENTLY]
ANA NAVARRO: [clip from Harris' interview on The View on 10/8/24] Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

COMMENTATOR 9: US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
LAURA INGRAHAM: The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
INTERVIEWER 1: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS : Yes.
CROWD: BOOO
TRUMP: You know she destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed California along with Gavin Newscum. Destroyed it.
Did you say when Newscum said that you're not allowed to even ask for voter ID? If anybody asks somebody for voter ID, it's considered a crime. [booing] You know why? Because they want to cheat. There's only one reason why.
We want to be very careful. Detroit, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to get out and vote right now. And with that, I'd like to acknowledge some of our great friends and he just spoke, so I don't want to have to waste his time. But he did just speak and he's great. He's one of our really true leaders in this country. We're all lucky to have him running for the Senate. Mike Rogers. Where's Mike? [cheers and applause] Mike, thank you, Mike.
And I don't want him to get up and use this crappy microphone that they sent. I don't want him to do that. I want to keep him good and healthy. Unlike Trump, I want him to have his voice tomorrow. When I get up tomorrow and I can't speak, I'm going to say Detroit did it to me, but that's what—[cheers and applause].
We're also pleased to be joined by a future star and, really, a current star. He's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. Congressman—Do you know who he is? Byron Donalds. [cheers and applause] Congressman Donalds, thank you. Thank you, Byron. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Thank you very much, Byron.
Michigan House Republican leader, Matt Hall. Matt, thank you, Matt. How are we doing here, Matt? We doing good? Going to win? I hope. We got to win. So far, we're winning. And Senate Republican leader, Eric Nesbitt. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Eric. Thank you very much, Eric.
A man that I said, ""You got to do this. You got to do it."" He wasn't sure if he wanted to. You know he had a great career. I said, ""I'm sorry, Pete Hoekstra. You got to do it. You got to become the GOP chairman.""
Ambassador Pete Hoekstra. Thank you, Pete. Great job. [cheers and applause]
So, Pete, are we going to win? Thus far, I hear like, ""Way above projection. We're not even talking about polls anymore. These are way above projection."" A man who is probably more knowledgeable about autoworkers for Trump and autoworkers, period, and who knows exactly what we're doing. He's a member of the union, but he's not happy with what they're doing with the whole thing, what they're doing. They've lost a lot of jobs over the last few months and it's going to continue until you have no jobs in this country. We're not going to let it happen. We are going to have more jobs and it's going to be more powerful as an automobile capital than it was in its heyday, 60 years, 70 years ago. [cheers and applause]
It's going to happen. It's going to happen fast.
Brian? Brian, stand up. Pannebecker. Brian Pannebecker, thank you very much. Thank you, Brian.
And Dr. Massad Boulos, great friend of mine, and Michael Boulos, my son-in-law, he's a wonderful young man. Stand up, please. That's good. That's good. [cheers and applause]
He got lucky, he married Tiffany, and they're having a baby. A beautiful little baby. [cheers and applause]
We also have a man highly respected in Michigan, Imam [Husham Al-]Husainy. Imam, please, wherever you may be, stand up. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you very much. Great honor to have you. [cheers and applause]
And we have a guy—I made so much money with this guy. He was brutal. He was a brutal man. Happened to come from a place called Detroit, or as they say, Detroit. He says, ""I come from Detroit,"" which is cool as hell if you're The Hitman, Tommy Hearns. The Hit Man. [cheers and applause] Tommy, come up here, Tommy. Come up. Come. Come. Come up here. Tommy the Hitman. We love Tommy. I won so much money betting on this guy. He was brutal. We love that. Look at him. He still looks good. He still looks good. Wow.
They have to take—Secret Service has got a little—I don't know, is there such a thing as overpr—[sic].But Tommy is going to have to cross about nine gates. I don't think so, Tommy. About 25 years ago, he would've just hopped over them. Hey, Tommy, you're still good, huh? You think I could take you now in a fight right now? [laughter] No, I don't think so. Look at him. He wants to—Oh, no, he wants to fight. [cheers and applause]
Oh, Tommy the Hitman. Man, oh, man. Some of the greatest fights in history. Oh, look, he wants to come up. We should have him up, right? [cheers and applause]
Come on, Tommy. Man, oh, man. I saw him in the audience. I said, ""We got to get—I see a lot of people in the audience. I'm not bringing them up. Come on, Tommy.
CROWD: Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
TRUMP: One of the greatest fighters of all time. And, man, I'll tell you what, he was something special. And thank you, Tommy. And he looks great, doesn't he? He looks great. [cheers and applause]
TOMMY HEARNS : Now, hearing those nice words coming from you, man, it's got to be real. It's got to be real. I got—because, I myself, I never thought I was told [inaudible] great fighter, but I thought I did a pretty good job. But hearing it come from you, Donald, I'm excited. Yeah. I'm very excited.
TRUMP: Ah that's good.
HEARNS: I wanna, I wanna fight now. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!
TRUMP: Man, he did, he—could he fight. He was a natural. He had the greatest—he had hips a little bit smaller than mine. He had shoulders a little bit larger than mine. See, he went in the right proportion. That's the way it's supposed to be, right? Thank you, Tommy. They love him in Detroit, right? They love him in Detroit. [cheers and applause]
Another man that they love in Detroit is a rapper and he's one of the hottest in the world, actually. Trick Trick. Where's Trick Trick. Trick Trick. Come here, Trick Trick. Come here. Maybe we should have him do a little rapping or something, huh? Come here. Look at him. He looks good. He looks good. You look good.
TRICK TRICK: What up now, Detroit! [cheers and applause]
If y'all know about Trick Trick, y'all know I'm about bringing it all to Detroit. So please welcome the 47th President of the United States, as we make Detroit great again. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. That's great.
You have some great people here, I'll tell you. This is a great place.
We are going to really make—We are. We're going to make it great again. Like the country, and we did it, and then we have to do it again because they blew it. They blew it to hell. But we're going to do it again. Thank you, Trick Trick.
Here are some of the facts on Kamala Harris. After talking to The Hitman and Trick Trick, it seems boring getting back into Kamala, but that's what we got to do. We got to save our country, right?
Mr. Wall. Mr. Wall, stand up please. This guy is great. You know he's a wealthy guy. He made a lot of money. He comes to—How many would you say? You're at 350 or something? He's got a lot. This guy's got lots of cash and I love his—Someday, I'm going to wear one of them to a rally.
Actually, I think it would be well-received because we built 571 miles of wall, we had it made, we were going to build another 200 miles of wall, and then they decided to sell it for five cents on the dollar. But we're going to get it done. We built much more than I said I was going to build.
And we had the safest border in the history of our country. By the way, my all-time favorite graph, can we put it up? [cheers and applause]
That's my all-time favorite. Illegal immigration saved my life, if you think about it. [laughter] But that arrow in the bottom, that's when I left office. That was the lowest point of illegal immigration, and that included drugs and uh so many other things. It was just everything. But it was also—They dealt with so many different elements of different forms of crime, the people that were coming in. And look what happened after that. Look at that. So that was me. That was me in the last day, and then you look, it was like a rocket ship. It was like Elon Musk set the rocket ship up and that was loaded up with criminals of the worst kind. And that's what we have now in our country.
And it's worse than that, because that one, I want to keep it just the way it was. I'm not going to change it at all. But the numbers on the right, they continue for a long time. It's just an amazing thing. But we love that piece of paper. We love that chart more than any. I sleep with it. I kiss it every night. [cheers and applause]
I do have that throbbing feeling in my right ear, throbbing feel. But that's okay. That's great. Thank you very much.
So that was the best in history. That was the best in recorded history, anyway. That was the lowest. It was the day I left office, they had human trafficking at a level, the lowest level. Now it's about 12 times. Sorry, and they traffic in women, they traffic not, I mean in children, but they traffic in women more than any other thing. It's a horrible, you wouldn't even believe it could be possible. So thank you very much. I just wanted to see if you had that. I looked to the right and a lot of things happened.
And you know, we went to Butler a few weeks ago and we had a celebration. 101,000 people showed up. 101,000. Butler, Pennsylvania, 101,000 people showed up and it was a beautiful tribute to Corey, the great firefighter. [cheers and applause]
He was a great guy, a big, big Trump fan, and two other wonderful gentlemen were really hurt badly. They thought they were not going to make it and the doctors did an unbelievable job, and they're getting better and better and better. But that's a rough thing. That was some evening, I will tell you. But what was really something, and we had an opera singer that was so incredible, right? We had an opera singer that was incredible. We had the Belles of Notre Dame. Now, they were recorded. We tried bringing them over, but they wouldn't let us do that. But we had a moment of silence. Then the bells rang and then the opera singer sang, and we had Ave Maria by Pavarotti. We had a whole night. It was an unbelievable tribute. It was a tribute to him. 101,000 people.
Kamala Harris is a radical left Marx, is rated even worse than Bernie Sanders and even worse than Pocahontas. Does anyone know Pocahontas? The great Pocahontas, they said, ""You should never use that term. Please apologize.""
I said, ""I'd like to apologize to the real Pocahontas for—"" [cheers and applause]
Kamala destroyed our border. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement. [booing] Anybody that wants to defund the police even for one day, we don't want them. They're not worthy of being the President of the United States. If you have that ideology, and she does, she's a Marxist, communist, fascist, anything you want.
Remember, I said we will never be a socialist country? Remember I said that? I'd said, ""We will not be a socialist country."" [cheers and applause]
And I was right. We skipped socialism, we went down to communism. So I was right. I like to be right. I was right for the wrong reasons, right?
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are the greatest people. They're tough, they're smart, and they love our country and they take people out that nobody else wants to touch. I have some friends in the front row, they're very tough. They're not doing it. They said, we'll pass. And she wants to get rid of them. She wants to get rid of ICE. She wants to ban fracking, and as California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as nonviolent crimes. She pledged, think of that, she pledged to confiscate your guns. Would anybody like to give up their guns? She wants to confiscate.
CROWD: NO
TRUMP: You feel a little safer when you have all these criminals. Think of it. They allow hundreds of thousands of prisoners to come into our country. Some are murderers, some are drug dealers. They come in and then they say, ""By the way, we're taking away your guns also,"" right? They don't go, ""Would anybody like to volunteer to give up your guns? Please raise your hand.""
Oh, we have a one guy. I think I have a feeling he won't be doing it when they—
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Good, thank you. Sit down. That's enough.
He's our friend, but that's enough.
And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She wants to endorse a ban, a big one. She already did. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention. How about that one?[booing]
And most importantly of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. That's not a big thing, but can I be honest with you? It's terrible.
But there is a video, we talk about woke and they want to take us woke. And we have a video that I think you'll enjoy. It's about when we won two World Wars, when we were the, although we did defeat ISIS in about four weeks. I will tell, we have a great, a great military, but I think you'll enjoy this. The way it used to be and the way it is right now.

TRUMP: Pretty cool, right? We won two World Wars. Remember that. We won plenty of others and we defeated ISIS so rapidly nobody can believe it, in a matter of weeks. They said it was going to take five years. We did it in a matter of weeks.
In conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. [cheers and applause]
We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always cherish our great American flag. We will cut your taxes, crush inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and create the greatest job boom the world has ever seen. We're going to do that very easily. Very easily. We will hire American, buy American, build American, grow American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause]
I will stop the—Absolutely darling. And I will stop the global theft of American jobs and turn the US into the manufacturing superpower of the world. I will end the war in Ukraine immediately. I will get it done while I'm President-elect. Stop the chaos in the Middle East and prevent World War III. We are very close to World War III. [cheers and applause] We are very, very close to World War III, because we have incompetent people. Ukraine would've never happened. October 7th would've never happened. Inflation would've never happened. It was caused by their stupid energy policy.
None of this stuff would've happened and we wouldn't have had that horrible situation in Afghanistan. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. 13 dead soldiers, many people dead, many people and soldiers just devastated, loss of legs and arms. All of that wouldn't have happened. And of course, we gave them tens of billions of dollars worth of brand new military equipment that I bought, I bought and they gave it away to the Taliban. I think it was the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. And because of that, Putin said, ""This is a paper tiger. I'm going to go into Ukraine.""
But he would've never done it if I were President. And even the Democrats admit that frankly, I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly, they so dearly deserve. [cheers and applause]
We will strengthen and modernize our military. You know, I rebuilt our military, we rebuilt our military, but we're going to bring it to a next step. We will build a missile defense shield, all made in the USA, a lot of it made right here. And we will put these Stars and Stripes on the surface of Mars, and maybe with the help of Elon, we'll get it done quickly. [cheers and applause]
We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will, remember this one, we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [cheers and applause] It'll be gone. And we will keep men out of women's sports.
I will defend religious liberty, your right to free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will do that. [cheers and applause] Second Amendment.
After years and years of building up other countries, we will protect our borders, defend our families, and protect our American suburb, cities, and towns like never before. We will end sanctuary cities and we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will put American citizens first. We will put American citizens first, American children first, American patients first. Our American taxpayers first, American workers first, and American communities first. [cheers and applause]
And we will put communists, Marxists, and fascists last if that's okay. And they will always be last. They will never make a comeback. They're getting very close. We've got to win this election or they're going to be there. They're going to be there. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. And we will be a strong, proud, and free nation once again. We will defend our civilization, reclaim our sovereignty, and I will give you back your freedom, your future, and your life.
Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. We want a landslide. And it looks like that could be happening, too big to risk. [cheers and applause]
Early voting is underway. So get everyone you know and go out and vote. Go tomorrow. It's just starting. Go and vote. Make sure you vote and bring all our friends that want to vote for us. Tell him, ""Jill, get your fat husband off the couch. Get that fat pig off the couch. Tell him to go and vote for Trump. He's going to save our country.""
Get that guy the hell off our—Get him up, Jill, slap him around. Get him up. Get him up, Jill, we want him off the couch to get out and vote. Bring your friends and get them out. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge. And this is true. I really believe this, we're on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country.
With your help from now until election day. We're talking about 19 days. 19. We will redeem America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. We have to take it back, because we've lost it. We've lost it. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will stop us. We will press forward to our magnificent American destiny and together we will fight, fight, fight and vote, vote, vote. And we will win, win, win. We're going to win, win, win.
And November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country.
And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. [cheers and applause]
We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. [cheers and applause]
And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause]
Thank you and God bless you all. God bless you. Thank you everybody. [cheers and applause]

    [music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the USA""]
TRUMP: Hello, everybody. Hello, Pennsylvania. We love Pennsylvania, that are very special. Hello to Latrobe. Oh, I love Latrobe. You know why? The home of Arnold Palmer. This was the home of my friend, Arnold Palmer, and he loved Latrobe. He turned out to be one of the greatest golfers in the world. He started off very, very poor. He had no money, just had a lot of talent and a lot of muscle. He was a strong guy. And his father worked at Latrobe golf course, and he was a laborer there. Actually they called him in those days sod carrier. He's a very strong man. He carried sod. They didn't have trucks that trucked it. They had strong people carrying. He was the strongest of them all. And he had a son, but they had no money. And he worked at Latrobe, and they treated him good because he could do more work than anybody else.
And his son had started to grow up and he realized his son was very strong like him, but he never had a chance to play golf. He had no money at all. And his son was named Arnold. And when Arnold was four and five years old, they had no money to buy a club. He couldn't buy one club, not one. And they used to go to the back of—This was all told to me by Arnold, so I have it firsthand. They used to go to the back room where the members were and they took out members' clubs and they'd use the members' clubs, two or three of them at night, late at night. And he hit balls with his son and he'd watch his son's every move. And he realized his son had great talent. And then his son got older and stronger, and then he got stronger and stronger.
And his father started saying, ""Wow, this is really crazy, what's going on with this kid."" And finally he was able to save up enough money to get him some clubs, but they weren't strong enough. Arnold was breaking them. He'd swing a regular club and it'd break the hell out of it because he was so powerful. And they went back to the members' bags because they couldn't afford another set and used very stiff shafted clubs, very strong for those of you that aren't golfers. That's for good golfers with power, very stiff shafted. And he'd get better and better. And then he went to high school and he won all sorts of championships, one after another. He'd beat the rich kids, he'd kill them. He'd beat them so badly. He loved beating them, even though he was a nice guy but he was tough. He was a tough cookie, Arnold.
I got to know him really well, and he'd beat them over and over again. And then he got a set of clubs and he got even better. And he won every championship. And he got into Wake Forest. You know that, right? Wake Forest. And he was immediately, as a freshman, the captain of the team. And there was a man named Mark McCormick. And Mark McCormick founded IMG. That's a very big—one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world today. And he wanted to be a professional golfer. He didn't go to Wake Forest, he went to another college, another school, and I won't say which, because honestly I didn't want to look it up. It wasn't worth it, but a good golf college. And he wanted to be a pro. He was a very good golfer, very, very good. And he had the privilege of playing Arnold Palmer in a match between Wake Forest and his college.
And the way he tells it, he was playing fantastically well, Mark McCormick, a very famous man actually, founder of the biggest entertainment company. And he was playing very well, playing Arnold. Arnold, Arnold was just Arnold. He was just better than anybody else in college. And somebody shouted over to Mark McCormick, ""How are you playing?"" He said, ""I'm playing great. Can't play better."" ""How are you doing?"" ""I'm six down."" And he realized at the end of that match that he would never be a pro because he could never beat a guy like this. It wasn't close. He said, ""He was longer, straighter, chipped better, putted better, and thought better. Other than that, they were very close."" But he gave it up. He said, ""I'm not going to be a golfer,"" but he went to Arnold. He said, ""Arnold, you're going to be turning pro and you're going to make a lot of money. And my second choice was to start representing people that are talented and I'd like you to be my first client.""
And they made a deal where Arnold owned a big piece of the company and Arnold started winning immediately, started winning immediately, made a lot of money for him. And Mark McCormick became the agent. And then because of Arnold's success, IMG, which most of you know, it's very, very big now, Hollywood stars, everything, IMG became well-known. And he started signing a lot of other players and a lot of other people. And then he started with Hollywood and they signed Hollywood stars. And it became the biggest of those companies like William Morris and all of them. And it was all because of Arnold. Arnold owned a big piece of it. Arnold was a very rich man. And I said to Arnold—I got to know him when he was 69 years old.
And I played pretty much with him, a lot of them. And as he got older—When you get older, you start to lose a thing called distance. And I'm a good golfer. Not like that but I'm a good golfer. And I felt so good because I was hitting it a little bit longer than Arnold. But he was by this time about 75, 76, and I'd hit it four or five yards past him. I said, ""Arnold, let me ask you, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, was I longer than you?"" He said, ""Donald—"" I wasn't president or close at that time. That was long before I decided to have this fun. [cheers and applause]
CROWD MEMBER: PA LOVES YOU!
TRUMP: But you're talking about a great man. I said, ""Arnold—"" And he was still plenty long, but I said, ""Arnold, do you think I was longer than you like I am now 30, 40 years ago?"" He goes, ""Donald, let me tell you a little secret. You weren't even close."" [laughing] He said, ""You see that tree out there?"" He pointed to a tree that was about 70 yards in front of us. He said, ""That's where I would drive it. And you're about 70 yards short of that tree. You would've been even worse then."" And it's true. He won, I think it was Pine Valley, one of the great courses. He won the US Open. He drove a par four, only person ever to drive that hole until that time. He drove it in a playoff, to win the playoff. He went over the trees, very risky shot.
He ended up driving the green and he won with a birdie in the hole. And nobody till that point had done anything like it. But I said to Arnold—He became very rich because of the investments and the IMG and all of the different things. And I said to Arnold, ""Just out of curiosity, you could live anywhere in the world. You could live on the Pacific Ocean, you could live on the Atlantic Ocean, you could live anywhere in the world. Why did you choose to stay?"" And part of the beauty is that because he made money right away—A lot of times it takes a pro years before they start making the money. It's a very, very difficult sport actually. But he started right away making money, and you know, the first thing he bought was Latrobe Golf Club. And you know the first thing he did? He took his father from a laborer to make him the course superintendent.
How cool is that? And then ultimately his father became the manager of the club. And Arnold was so proud, and his father was good. He said, ""One thing with my father, nobody's going to steal on me."" He said that. And I said that too. I said, ""There's something nice."" And then I took Arnold when he was quite old in all fairness—We took a helicopter from where he was in Florida to Doral. I own Doral, which is a great place. And it's got four courses, many championships. Many of the best championships were at Doral. And I was building these beautiful—They call them villas, about 88 units in each one, hotel villas. And I named them after the 10 greatest golfers, including like Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Slammin' Sammy Snead, all great players. And I said, ""Arnold, I really want to name one after you. Would you like it?""
He said, ""I'd love it. I'd be honored to have that."" And we flew down for the opening ceremony to cut a ribbon for the Arnold Palmer Villa. And it's to this day, people just love it. And I'll never forget the day, he was having a little hard time. [applause] He was a little older. He hit the eighties. He hit the eighties, but when he got up there, he had that magic like nobody had. And there were a few golfers that could—You could say maybe slightly better, a few, not many, but there was nobody that had his magic. He was a thriller. He was unbelievable. He knew how to win and he knew how to just do whatever it was that electrified a crowd. If I had him here right now with me, this crowd would be going absolutely crazy.
They'd say, ""Trump, get off the stage. We want Arnold Palmer to speak."" He would electrify a crowd and he would go for shots that nobody else would do and they were risky as hell. And sometimes it wouldn't work out, but usually it did with him. He was an incredible man. He was an incredible champion. And he came from Latrobe. And so when I said—A couple of days ago, I said, ""Where are we going to be today?"" They said, ""Sir, we're going to be at Latrobe."" I said, ""Do you know what that means?"" ""No, sir. What does it mean?"" I said, ""That means Arnold Palmer,"" because Arnold told me he could be, and I knew he could be. They wanted him everywhere. Just like I wanted to name a villa after him. Everybody wanted him. He could have been in any place he wanted.
He said, ""No, this is where I want to be. This is the place I love. I mean, how good is that, right? And he died a very proud owner of this course. And he was always tinkering with it. I said, ""Arnold, what are you doing?"" He said, ""Well, I'm moving the whole four yards back."" I said, ""Nobody knows the difference, Arnold."" He said, ""I don't care. I love it. I love this place."" He could not get enough of Latrobe. So I've been here before, and I told the story before, not in this kind of detail, because you have these teleprompters. If I would read it off a teleprompter, it wouldn't be so good, right? And it would be a lot shorter. It wouldn't be as good. And I didn't want to do that. I said, ""When I come here, I'm going to tell them the real story of Arnold.""
But Arnold Palmer was all man. And I say that in all due respect to women, and I love women, but this guy, this is a guy that was all man. [cheers and applause] This man was strong and tough. And I refuse to say it, but when he took showers with the other pros, they came out there, they said, ""Oh my God, that's unbelievable."" [laughing] I had to say it. We have women that are highly sophisticated here, but they used to look at Arnold, this is bad, but he was really something special. Arnold was something special. So I just want to tell you, you're very lucky, the people that live in Latrobe, and it's an honor for me to be here because of him. Actually, he was a great man. And I don't think there would be golf—To the extent that you have it today, it probably wouldn't be that way without the great Arnold Palmer. So enjoy it, everybody. [cheers and applause]
And I had to tell you the shower part of it because it's true. What can I tell you? We want to be honest. We want to be upfront. It's true. But I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible Commonwealth with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. I'd like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: After living through this nightmare of inflation, invasion, and humiliation? You know what the invasion is, right? Invasion by the southern border. What they've done to our country is unbelievable, allowing more than 21 million people into our country. Many of them are murderers, many of them are drug dealers, and they're from mental institutions. He says, ""Send the back."" You right. Do you come from the drug business? Yeah, he does. But Americans are ready to be free from Kamala Harris.
Do you know that whenever I use the word Harris, everybody says, ""Who's Harris?"" They have no idea who Harris is. That's true. They have no idea who's Harris but Kamala—And to reclaim the future that is rightfully yours, you're going to reclaim it. This election is a choice between whether we will have a incredible four more years of failure, such a horrible four years. Everything they touched turns to—
CROWD: SHIT!
TRUMP: Everything, inflation, Afghanistan—How about Afghanistan? Most embarrassing moment in the history of—[booing] Everything they've touched. Even now, he's telling Israel—Everything he said to Israel was exactly the opposite. He's the greatest—I will say this about Biden. He's the single greatest expert on foreign policy in history. You know what that means? If you did the exact opposite of what he suggested every single time, you'd go down as the greatest foreign policy president in history, if you did the exact opposite. [cheers and applause] Everything's a failure.
And he's telling Bibi, Netanyahu, ""Don't do this. Don't do that. Don't do this. All our great congressmen are there. Don't do any of these things."" And Bibi didn't listen to him. And I tell you what, they're in a much stronger position now than they were three months ago, that's for sure. Nobody's ever seen anything like this happen. And Bibi called me today and he said, ""It's incredible what's happened."" I said, ""It's pretty incredible."" But he wouldn't listen to Biden because if he did, they wouldn't be in this position. And she's worse than him. She's not as smart as him. And I'm not saying he's the smartest. I'm not saying he's the smartest, but she's not as smart as him. And I think maybe you know, based on early results, maybe he'd be doing better than her. We have results coming out where we actually now don't have to rely on the polls.
We are doing good on the polls, but we don't have to rely on the polls. Remember, they stole the election from an American president. They stole it. I could say—I don't even want to call it, they just stole the election. They said, ""We're taking the election away."" He got 14 million votes and he won. 22 people running, 22 Democrats, they're running. I'm looking at my hair up there. Let's see. [laughing] I don't like it. I don't like it. Excuse me, I'm going to recomb my hair. Do you mind? I'll leave the stage for five minutes. I'm going to recomb my hair, Mr. Future Senator. We have David down here, Mr. Future Senator. You've got to get him in. [cheers and applause]
You're doing good too. Well, let's keep it the way it is. Let's just keep going, right? We'll trudge through it. But this election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of failure and disaster. And that's what it's been. It's been failure. We're disrespected all over the world. They're laughed at all over the world. They're laughing at him and they're laughing at her. The other night, they had Catholic charities. They had the most—the biggest event, the Al Smith Dinner. It's the biggest event of the year for Catholics. [cheers and applause] And she's the only one in years, decades that didn't show up. She didn't show up. She wouldn't be there. [booing]
She wouldn't be there. She said no, and she ended up doing a tape that was pathetic and it was an insult to Catholics frankly because she was actually sort of knocking them or knocking religion. Then she had the other event the other day where she said, ""You're in the wrong location,"" when they started talking about a certain subject, which basically was a knock on Christianity and a knock on religion because she doesn't know what the hell she's saying. But they had been a failure. It's been a disaster. Or you're going to have four years and they will be the four greatest years in the history of our country if we make the proper decision. You've got to make that decision. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, if you're Catholic, you can't vote after that and you can't vote for another reason. That administration has been persecuting Catholics. It's been persecuting Catholics. I don't know why. Persecuting a lot of people. Persecuting politicians. I'll raise my hand, but we're kicking their ass. They are bad. They are bad. They are bad. Guys going to jail. They've never done this. This has never happened. It happens in third-world countries, in Banana Republics. They go after—It's called weaponization. They weaponize their justice departments. I call it the Department of Injustice. Ours is the Department of Injustice, but we're doing well. We won the big case in Florida. You saw that? [cheers and applause] That was the big one. That was the big one. That was the big one.
""They're going to get him on that one. Oh, they're going to get him."" We had a judge who was brilliant and fair and very smart. She ruled against them, very strongly against them. These are dishonest people that we're dealing with, but we won that. And we have other ones. We have them on the ropes. Remember, they were going to have me in oh such a trouble. I'm going to be in trouble. And in the meantime, it's just weaponization of government. That made me more popular. It actually made me more popular, I think. That's crazy. [cheers and applause]
Because people can see, and they're smart, and we could sometime explain it, but one after another—You had Fani, F-A-N-I, [booing] which is usually pronounced Fanny, and she added a little action to it, Fah-ni [sic]. That was a scam. They're all scams. They're all scams. It's a corrupt system, and it's a corrupt justice department, and it's a corrupt DA, corrupt Attorney Generals. They use it to get elected because you can't get elected with open borders, with transgender operations all over the place, with men playing in women's sports, [booing] with high taxes and banned schools. No school choice. You can't get elected with all—I could go on for 10 minutes.
CROWD MEMBER: World War 3.
TRUMP: Your vote will decide whether we give up on America or whether we save America. It is the most important election you're ever going to have. [cheers and applause] Really is. By the way, how nice is this place? Isn't it beautiful? [cheers and applause] Look, people, as far as you can see, they give you a little extra security nowadays, you notice? [laughing] Hey, I got more machine guns than I've ever seen in—Look at these guys. I got more machine—
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I never saw guns like that. I said to my son, Don—He knows a lot about guns, and Eric knows a great shot. They really understand. I said, ""What kind of a gun is that?"" They said, ""Dad, you don't even want to know."" They are serious guns. We've got more guys and everyone who's like central casting too. Holy shit, I'm looking. They look like Arnold Palmer. They look like Arnold. Can't look better than Arnold. But with your support, we'll bring back our nation's strength, dominance, prosperity, and pride. We're going to do it. This will be America's new golden age. 100 years from now, the presidential election of 2024 will be looked upon as America's greatest victory. [cheers and applause] I hope that's true because we've been through so much together, and the finish line is finally in sight. After four horrendous years, Kamala Harris can't say one thing that she'd do differently.
Right? You heard that. If you vote for me, I will end inflation, I will bring jobs back to our country. We'll flood—we'll flood our shores with companies and jobs. We'll seal our borders immediately and we'll let people in. We had the safest border in the history of our country. Hold it, put up my favorite sign of all time, put up my favorite graph. I have to use it, my favorite graph. [cheers and applause] So the red arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest number of illegal immigrants to come into this country. And by the way, we want people to come into the country, but they have to come in legally just so we understand, right? She's going, ""Yeah."" We want it, we need them because we're going to need them because we're going to have so many companies come in just through adjustments in tariffs and taxes. They're going to come pouring into our country, and they're going to stay here because we're going to protect them with tariffs.
The word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. More beautiful than love. More beautiful than respect. No, less beautiful than religion, though. I don't want to get into that argument, but the word tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary. Remember that. It's going to make our country rich and our politicians were too stupid for so many years or something else was going on. [gesturing to crowd member] He goes, ""Crooked."" That could be. Because it's so simple to understand, but look at that. So that was the day I left office, that lower red arrow. [gesturing to screen] That's the lowest point. And look what happened to our country after that. [booing] Look at that.
And that was done by Border Patrol, which we love. Oh, by the way, Border Patrol gave us their total and complete endorsement, and it's hard. [cheers and applause] They're not actually supposed to do it. They said, ""Well, let them take all 29,000 of us and let's see what happens to this country."" No, they're not—In theory, you work for the government. They couldn't help. And they said, ""She's horrible."" They said, ""She's horrible."" It wasn't just—They said, ""You're the greatest president in the history of our country."" Some only said, ""The greatest in our lifetime."" They had a unanimous endorsement from everybody. And they said at the same time, ""She's the worst we've ever had by far."" And now she's running. And I tell you, I think that the border—I was just saying to Byron Donald in the plane. Right, Byron? I was just in up, Byron, what a great guy. [cheers and applause]
Look at that black hat. So you know what? You know who the founder of that hat is? Elon. Elon Musk. He wore it. He's like the founder. We sell that. I think we sell about two a year. Now it's the hottest hat we have. And Elon came up—Elon Musk gave us his total endorsement. How good is that? [cheers and applause] He's the one that landed that rocket. That rocket came in. I said, ""That sucker is not going to make it."" I was actually on the phone talking to somebody. It was crazy. And I'm talking to this person and I'm saying, ""Wait a minute. Something's happening. I got to hold. Just hold it."" I put the phone—And it was a very important person. I just—I'm looking at something on the screen. I'm seeing this 24 story tube come down, and it looked like it was getting—Congressman, it looked like it was getting a little bit close to the gantry, or whatever the hell they call that nowadays. I said, ""Oh my God."" And I put the phone down. Very important person, by the way.
I won't tell you who, it'll be embarrassing, because I never picked up the phone again. I was sitting there for—And because I was the president and because I'm leading, which is probably more important to him, the guy didn't hang up. He was on the phone, forty-five, fifty minutes waiting. I just saw, ""Oh, the phone's off the hook. Hello, hello."" And he went—But I saw this thing come down, this tube, this giant tube, and I put the phone, I said, ""Just a second."" I said, ""I don't believe it,"" because I had the sound off. I turned the sound up and it came down and I said, ""It's going to crash. Don't crash."" Actually, at first, I thought it was like a movie or something. I never saw this before, and I've seen a lot. And it came down and it was going into—And then all of a sudden you see the fire pouring out of the left side, pushed it over. It landed perfectly, and then it was grabbed by two claws, two giant claws, and they grabbed it like Willie Mays would catch a fly ball in center field, right?
That's the way it was. He was pretty good, Willie. And they came down and I called Elon. I said, ""Elon, is that you?"" He said, ""That was me."" I said, ""Can anyone else do that?"" ""No."" ""Can the United States do it?"" ""No."" "" Can Russia do it, China do it?"" ""No, nobody can do that."" He said, ""They're 10 years behind."" This guy is great. And he said, ""If Donald Trump doesn't win, it could be the end of democracy in our country, it could be the end of our country."" And you know where he is today? He's in another part of the Commonwealth. Never ever make the mistake of calling it a state, by the way. It could be career ending. I had a friend that did that, a politician. He used to be a politician. It shouldn't be that big a deal because a lot of people make that mistake. That's one I could understand somebody making, but we call it the Commonwealth.
But Elon endorsed me. He's in another part of the Commonwealth, and he's campaigning now, and he's got—Actually, he's got a gold. He's got a gold cap, but he called it. He was wearing the black hat in Butler, Pennsylvania. [cheers and applause] We had 101,000 people, Butler, honoring Cory, the fire fighter. Butler, Pennsylvania, we had 101,000 people. It was unbelievable. What a night that was. And we were honoring Cory and two gentlemen who were very badly hurt. We thought they weren't going to make it, the doctors up there. They have good doctors. These are good doctors. I don't know if they call them country doctors, but whoever they are, they were good because these were two men that were not the two great supporters who were not supposed to make it. And they made it. And they made it. They'll be okay. But Cory didn't make it.
And we honored Cory. It was the most beautiful evening. We had a moment of silence, and then we had the bells of Notre Dame, right? Notre Dame playing. And then we had an opera singer who sounded just like Pavarotti. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, and he sang Ave Maria, and our whole place was crying. It was crazy. I'm looking at the audience. Some of my friends were there, almost as tough as the football players that we have. We have some of the great football players. [cheers and applause] Almost as tough. I don't know if you guys did, but they were tough cookies, and I see them crying. They're trying to be cool. ""No, I wasn't crying,"" but the whole place was crying. It was amazing. It was 101,000 people.
So we will regain our sovereignty, we'll restore our safety, and we will unlock the magnificent destiny that is just within our reach. And I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Again, you're going to be excited. [cheers and applause] This is going to be the most exciting period ever. Every problem facing us can be solved, but now the fate of our nation is in your hands. It really is. I mean, if you put these lunatics in charge any longer, we can't take it any longer. They're laughed at. They're laughed at by foreign leaders. They think we're—They can't even believe it. They can't even believe it. Biden can't find his way off a platform. She's worse. I wonder if she's going to have any trouble. No, she should be probably okay in that regard. But she's worse up here.
Pennsylvania, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris, who shouldn't be there, she shouldn't be. She's a threat to democracy. The way they took over. They called me a threat to democracy, right? She's a threat to democracy because she shouldn't even be the candidate. They should have picked a candidate fairly, not just given her because they want to be politically correct. [cheers and applause]
I mean, whether you like him or not, you know, we had the debate, and his numbers went down. He didn't have a good night, but that can happen. But that happens. And the numbers go down. And they went down, and they went into them. They said, ""We're not going to let you run. We're going to take it away."" That's crazy. Nancy went in, Chuck Schumer went in. Some of the people went in. They took it away from him. They just took it away from him. It's bad. And that is a threat to democracy if you think about it, right? That's a real threat to democracy.
But you have to tell Kamala Harris—
CROWD MEMBER: You're fired.
TRUMP: And by the way, I think he would've—Let's see what happens. And I may be wrong, but let's see what happens. I think he might've done better than she's going to do because all we had to do is expose her as a lunatic left, further left than Pocahontas. Do you know who Pocahontas? [laughing] Elizabeth Warren. She's further left than Pocahontas, and I don't want to get into that stuff, but her mother said she was Indian because she had high cheekbones. That's what she said.
And then she went out and did a test because I was driving her crazy, calling her Pocahontas. So she fell for the trap, and she did a test, and she was so happy, because it came back 1,014th, remember? 1,014th, and that was it. That means I had more Indian blood in me than she had, and I have none. I have none. I'd like to have some. I would like to have some. I'd be honored, but I have more, and I have none. But she was so happy when she got—Think of that. That was what happened. That was the end of her career. That was the end of her presidential run.
She was leading for the president. And when she said—And you got to understand, just these are the people we're dealing with, she took that Indian heritage and based on the fact, and this is her statement. This is not me. There's no racist anything in me, not a drop, but this is not me. Her mother told her this, that she had high cheekbones, and therefore she was part Indian. And based on that, she applied to colleges. She applied for jobs, she applied for the US Senate, and everyone's forgotten that crap right now, but I never forget it.
But she went out, and she had the test, and the test was ridiculous, basically. And then I said that I have more than she does, and I would love to. I will tell you, but she's bad news. But she's radical, left crazy. She drives people—What she does to business people is horrible. She's a horrible person, but she's radical left and crazy. Bernie is radical left. And this one, Kamala, is further left than them. So you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough, that you just can't take it anymore. We can't stand you. You are a shit Vice President. [cheers and applause] The worst. You're the worst Vice President. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. You're fired. Get out of here. Get the hell out of here, Kamala. [cheers and applause]
Early voting in Pennsylvania is now underway. Go and vote. Just go and vote. Get out there. And if you've not registered to vote, you only have two days left. You have to get out there and register immediately. Does everybody promise they're going to register? Okay? [cheers and applause] Boy, look at the crowd. Wow. Wow. Hello, everybody. How did the flyover look? [cheers and applause] Good? Good. It feels like you're very close to the ground. I said, ""Are we okay here?"" It looks like okay from here, but let me tell you, you're in that plane, that sucker feels low. I'm saying, ""I hope everything's working nicely on that plane."" With your help, 17 days from now, we are going to win Pennsylvania. We're going to defeat Kamala Harris, and we are going to make America great again, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: And I'm in big trouble tonight. You know why Franklin Graham wrote me. You heard this. Like two months ago. He said, ""President, we love your stories. We love your speaking. We love everything about you. You're a great Christian. We love everything about you, but sir, please, please don't use any bad language, bad words."" He said, ""Your stories will even be better."" And I wrote them back. I said, ""I'm going to try and do that, but actually the stories won't be as good."" Because you can't put the same emphasis on—So tonight I broke my rule. I've done it for weeks, but tonight I just said, ""Look, I'm in Pennsylvania. What the hell?"" [cheers and applause] What the hell? I went to school here. I went to school. I went to the great Wharton School of Finance here. What a great school that was too. What a great school. So if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole damn thing, right? [cheers and applause]
And starting on day one of my new administration, I will end Kamala Harris' war on Pennsylvania energy because you know she's gonna ban fracking, right? A 100%. She was against fracking, against all this stuff, and then all of a sudden, about a year and a half ago when she was getting killed in the polls, she said, ""I like fracking very much."" Look, they always go back to what they want. They always go back. She can't help it. She's a radical left Marxist. She can't help it. But we're going to end that, and we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause]
We're going to drill, baby, drill. We're going to be drilling so deep. We're going to be for these guys. We're going to drill. We're going to take out so much money. We're going to pay down our debt. We're going to lower your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country. And we had the best economy in the history of our country, and we had the best border in the history of our country.
Other than that, what the hell? I did other things too. I rebuilt the military, and unfortunately, they gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. [booing] These geniuses, these stupid people like Milley, General Milley. Remember his performance in Congress? General Milley and Mattis, all these guys, what a bunch of lightweights. But we have great generals, but they're the ones you don't see on television. They're the ones that actually have to fight. Like we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate with great generals and great—We have a great military, but not the ones you see on television. Not the movie actors that you see. Kamala has said repeatedly, she wants to ban fracking, which would kill over 500,000 jobs in Pennsylvania alone. Watch this.
[start of video montage]
KAMALA HARRIS [montage of clips from Harris statements]: There's no question, I'm in favor of banning fracking. I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all. If they fail to act, as President of the United States, I am prepared to get rid of the filibuster to pass a Green New Deal. I am offering a Green New Deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive.
INTERVIEWER 1: He's going to bring the Green New Deal up for a vote.
HARRIS: Yeah, I will vote for it. It is a resolution. I believe that the underlying principles behind it are sound and important.
INTERVIEWER 2: What is the solution for voters who have jobs and interests in the fossil fuel industry?
HARRIS: Giving the workers an ability to transition into the jobs of the future.
INTERVIEWER 3: Can we afford it?
HARRIS: Of course we can afford it. It's not about cost.
[end of video] [booing]
TRUMP: So when she does that, that's the end of Pennsylvania as we know it. It's your most important, not only from the standpoint of 500,000 jobs, it's 500,000 jobs, but in terms of income for the state, you would have to double and triple your taxes to make up. And she's going to do it. She's going to do it. She's going to do it.
And you know, the other thing, the taxes. You know what an unrealized capital gain is? Okay? I'll tell you what it is, communism is what—So she wants to have a tax. So capital gains tax is terrible, it's rough, but you sell something, you can pay the tax. She wants an unrealized capital gain every year so that if something goes up in value, now you have to go out. It'll be a great business for appraisers and for lawyers and for accountants. Other than that, it's a disaster. She wants an unrealized, and she refuses to say that, ""No, we're not going to do that."" She refuses. Think of it. It's an unrealized gain. She wants that. So she wants to tax an unrealized gain. This woman is crazy.
I will terminate the Green New Scam immediately. It's the greatest scam in history. [cheers and applause] I'll stop the energy price hikes. I will rescind the natural gas export ban, which is killing your state, by the way, and we will have energy independence. We were energy independent four years ago. Think of it, energy independent. We're still going to be energy dominant, and I will cut your energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months of taking office, 50%. [cheers and applause] We have it. It's under our feet. We don't have to get it from Venezuela. We get it from Venezuela. The whole thing's not believable.
For most of American history, Pennsylvania was the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the United States, but year after year, globalist radical politicians and incompetents like Kamala Harris have waged a war on your Commonwealth. They've annihilated your steel mills, decimated your coal jobs, assaulted your oil and gas jobs, and sold off your manufacturing jobs to China and foreign nations all over the world.
Under the Trump administration, we are going to take back what is ours. We will end the looting and pillaging of Pennsylvania and many other states all over our country. We will bring back our manufacturing jobs, our energy jobs, our coal jobs, our steel jobs, and our dreams. [cheers and applause]
And it's all very simple. Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy costs, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market anywhere on the planet. But only if they make their products right here in America. If they don't, they have to pay a higher tariff and only if they hire American workers for the job, and they will. [cheers and applause] They'll all be coming. They'll be pouring in. If these companies don't make their product here, then they will pay a tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our cherished companies. We're going to protect our workers and our company. It's all very simple. We don't do any of this now.
I was going to do it, and then COVID came, and I said, ""We got to fight that one."" We did a great job with that. I got great credit for the economy, for the military. We were in no wars. Think of it. I started no wars. Everybody thought I'd be in a war. I'll be in a war in two days. No, it didn't work out. My personality stopped wars. Stopped wars. It also, it stopped wars in countries that we weren't even involved. I was able to stop wars with other countries that we weren't even that involved with just by making a couple of phone calls. I saved a lot of lot of lives.
We will call this policy the ""Build It in America"" plan because when foreign leaders and CEOs call me up to complain about our tariffs, my answer will be very simple to them, ""Build it in America, build it in Pennsylvania."" We're going to build a lot. We're going to have all those hulks that you have all over the place, the big empty hulks that we have all over our country. They're going to be loaded up with companies. Honestly, they'll be ripped down, and you'll see modern buildings built, modern manufacturing built. The centerpiece of this plan will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate, cutting the tax from 21% to 15, but again, only for those who make their product in the USA. [cheers and applause] And remember, I got it down to 21. Everyone said it would be impossible to get approved by Congress. I got it approved by Congress, but I got it down to 21. It was close to 40%. I got it down to 21%. Nobody thought that was possible. Now, I'm taking it from 21% down to 15%. The companies are going to roar in because 21% is very competitive. 15% is really, it's amazing.
I mean, companies are gonna want to be here, but they have to be protected from other companies coming in from the outside and raiding the jobs, the products. And that's what we're doing with the tariffs. And for those companies who don't make their product in America, they will be forced to pay a very stiff tariff. And we will make it and take it. Hundreds of billions of dollars are going to come in through tariff dollars to benefit American citizens, and we're going to pay off debt and reduce your taxes still further.
Again, I gave you the biggest tax cut in history. We'll be able to do it still further. And remember this, for decades, nobody paid. China never paid one penny, not one penny to us until I came along. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes under me. Under Bush, under Obama, they never paid. They never paid anything, nothing, not a dime. Hundreds of billions of dollars they paid. And that's just the beginning.
We're a rich country, but we don't know how to be rich. We just don't know how to be. But we're going to be rich, and we're going to be richer than ever before. We're going to take care of ourselves. It's going to be America first. It's also going to be, we'll help the world. We want to help the world, but it's time that we take care of ourselves. We owe $36 trillion dollar. We're going to take care of ourselves first. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: And I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families, and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the Earth. [cheers and applause]
And I will also protect our steel industry. If you guys remember, we were going to lose our steel. We had the worst policy on steel. China was coming in and others, dumping steel onto our shores. And we would've had no steel industry left. And I put a tariff, a big tariff on all steel coming in. It was not good steel either. It was what we call dirty steel. It was bad steel, bad structurally, very dangerous, actually. But they were dumping steel into our country, destroying our steel mills. And I put a big tariff, and it all stopped. when I did that, it all stopped. And we took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and it all stopped.
And you know, we slashed foreign steel exports. All these exports that were pouring in, they stopped to the level of about 25%. Nobody could believe it. And I hadn't even started yet. We were just getting ready. We were going to make this country richer than it had ever been before. You know in the 1890s and 1880s, our country was actually the richest it ever was. They had to form committees to determine, how are we going to spend this vast wealth? We had so much wealth, relatively speaking, so much wealth, more than anybody by far. And they formed up blue ribbon committees. ""How are we going to spend the money? We don't know how to spend it."" Wouldn't that be a nice problem to have?
CROWD MEMBER: Yeah!
TRUMP: We were a tariff country. And McKinley was President. William McKinley was actually a great president, was assassinated, by the way. He was assassinated. Being president is a very dangerous profession. If you're an auto racer, you know how many people die? About one-tenth of 1%. If you're a bull rider, that's dangerous. That's more dangerous than playing in the NFL, right, fellas, what do you think? I think it's a little more. I don't know. It's pretty dangerous. We got a couple of big, big deals over here, but I think that bull riding stuff, that looks bad. One-tenth of 1% about the same as the auto racing.
If you're president, take a look, it's about 5%, 6%. That's a lot better. But it's only good if you want to do one thing. You want to make your country strong and wonderful and great, and that's what I'm doing. But it is a dangerous profession, and we can't let it be a dangerous profession. We have to have better everything.
Actually, we have to have better respect from countries that look at us because we have to let them—I'm still waiting for Biden to say, ""If you do anything to this guy that I hate, I hate Trump. But if you do anything to him, we're going to blow your country to pieces."" And then you wouldn't need all this glass up here. You wouldn't need all the glass.
And other presidents have said that. And even if it's your opponent, and even if it's somebody that helped them force you out of an election, which I didn't want to do, but you got to do that, regardless. Opponent or no opponent, you got to let a country know that you're going to play around, we're going to blow you to pieces, and then everything will stop. It'll be amazing. [cheers and applause]
But today I'm honored to receive the endorsement of three union locals representing US steel, Mon Valley. [cheers and applause] And if they want, I'd like to call them up to the stage, including union leaders, Brian Pavlak and Richard Tikey, and Jason Zugeis. Would you come on up here, fellas? These are good-looking people. Good-looking guy. Yeah. [Trump shakes hands and greets the union leaders as they come to the stage.]
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. You guys can say something too. Thank you. thank you very much. That's great.
UNION MEMBER: Pleasure.
TRUMP: [inaudible] yeah, yeah, it's pretty simple. It's pretty simple.
UNION MEMBER: Mr. President.
UNION MEMBER: It's an honor.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
UNION MEMBER: Pleasure to meet you. [inaudible].
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
UNION MEMBER: Thank you.
UNION MEMBER: Yes, you did. That's why we're here, buddy.
Donald Trump: Would somebody like to say something?
UNION MEMBER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Please, go ahead.
UNION MEMBER: Brian started our movement, President Trump.
Donald Trump: Good.
BRIAN PAVLAK: It's an honor to be on stage with you. All the steelworkers here, honor to be on stage with you. I was at the Butler rally when they tried to assassinate you. And I knew after that, that I had to do whatever I had to do, so the president that saved the steel industry with tariffs. You saved it with tariffs.
TRUMP: Thank you.
PAVLAK: And you're my hero, and you're the greatest president ever. [cheers and applause]
UNION MEMBER: We love you.
PAVLAK: We love you. So steelworkers for Trump and the rank-and-file Mon Valley works want to endorse you. We want to give you a hard hat [cheers and applause] and also another hat too. Well, thank you, President Trump.
UNION MEMBER: Thank you, it's such an honor.
TRUMP: Thank you. We're going to get a lot of-
UNION MEMBER: We love no tax on overtime. Yeah, no tax on overtime.
TRUMP: That's [inaudible]
UNION MEMBER: Yeah. You know the steelworkers work a lot of overtime.
Donald Trump: [inaudible].
UNION MEMBER: No, no.
UNION MEMBER: No child support in overtime.
TRUMP: That's another one.
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible] put the hard hat on.
UNION MEMBER: [inaudible].
PAVLAK: Could we get a picture with you?
TRUMP: Yeah, let's go. Come on. Let's do it real fast, guys. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. [Trump puts on hard hat. Cheers and applause.]
UNION MEMBER: Beautiful, beautiful.
TRUMP: Thank you, let's take a picture, come on. Got it?
UNION MEMBER: Got it.
TRUMP: They've got it outside. Okay, he's got it right there. [points to person in crowd]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Let's go. We gotta get back. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
UNION MEMBER: So awesome, thank you.
TRUMP: Thank you.
UNION MEMBER: Thank you. [union member takes selfie with Trump as it takes off the hard hat.]
TRUMP: Thank you very much. That's a lot of uh, lot of strength up here, a lot of great people, actually, Thank you very much, have a good time.
UNION MEMBER: Good luck, President Trump.
UNION MEMBER: Save our steel.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. They said you did stay. We really did. We saved the steel industry in this country. Now we're going to make it really powerful again, along with autos. [cheers and applause] Great guys, great people. Those are great people. I'm also—and that have been beaten up for a lot of years unfairly because we had stupid politicians or corrupt politicians, I'm not sure which.
I'm also honored to have the overwhelming endorsement of the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters. [cheers and applause] That never happened before, never happened before, never happened before. And also we have something else, the law enforcement. Virtually every group in the United States from law enforcement, every single group. The sheriffs, the police, the Fraternal Order, 400,000 police, they all endorsed me, so thank you very much. Thank you. [cheers and applause] I don't think she has one. She's a disaster. She want to defund. She was involved in defund the police. I think when you defund the police, that's the end of that.
With four more years of Kamala, Harris, Pennsylvania will be an economic wasteland. That's going to happen. And I'll tell you with me, you're going to make more money than they've ever made before. You're going to have the best salaries, the lowest taxes. You're going to be doing better than you ever did. And we're going to put this into motion fast. You can do it very fast. It's very simple too. Kamala's inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 in higher prices, and now she wants to raise typical family taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Just take a look at this video please.
[start of video]
NARRATOR: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: Kamala's plan will raise families taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are going to have to go up.
NARRATOR: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or Social Security.
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: You know what they said to me up here? ""We like the overtime the best."" I said, ""yeah, you probably—"" You like the overtime, right fellas? That's it. I figured you had something. That's right. You're not worried about the tips. You like that overtime, right? But a lot of people like the tips. And if you're a senior, you like—you know what you like. You want the Social Security, no tax on Social Security. Think of no tax. No tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors. And they deserve it because you know what? Inflation with their fixed income, mostly fixed income, inflation has absolutely destroyed our seniors and other people that are on fixed income. So I will also make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. That's a big deal. [cheers and applause]
They said, one of the top guys on Wall Street called up and he said, ""We have an incredible situation here. Where did you come up with that?"" It's like the paperclip. I said it the other day, like 125 years ago, some guy took some steel and he bent it around a little bit. He came up with a paperclip and other people looked at it. He made a lot of money, very rich man. And they said, ""Why the hell didn't we think of it?"" You know, the one having to do with the deductibility of car loans, so simple. And the top guys on Wall Street, real geniuses, they called up. They said, ""How did you think of that? It's so simple."" But to have the American dream, you want to have a car, and I think this is going to be fantastic for Detroit and South Carolina and Tennessee and all of the areas that produce cars.
One thing I have to say, also. We have, in Mexico, and I've been talking about it for the last year and a half. China is getting ready to build massive car plants, massive, which would wipe out Michigan, would hurt you, but would wipe out Michigan. Detroit would be gone. And they're the biggest plants in the world. I have a friend that does that. He builds plants. He doesn't do anything else. All he wants to do is build plants. And I called him up a year ago, a little more than that. I said, ""I want to see a plant. I want to go see a plant."" You think Biden calls people up and says, ""I'd like to see a plant?"" I don't think so. He wants to go to sleep, and she wants to do other things. We don't know what they are. We'll find out, unfortunately.
No, but I said, ""I want to see a plant."" He said, ""Well, I can't really take you to the US because we're not building the good ones, but the big ones are being built in Mexico."" I said, ""What do you mean, Mexico?"" They're being built by China, and they're the biggest in the world, actually. One plant will be doing more than all of Michigan. So I said, ""This is not good.""
And then they think they're going to take the cars, build them, and sell them over to the United States, or go around the little horn and sell them to the United States, and destroy our automobile—And it would. It would destroy. So I said, ""I've had it,"" and I started talking about tariffs. We're going to put massive tariffs on these companies that are coming in and destroying our jobs and our companies.
And so I went very public with it for the last four months about tariffs. I love tariffs. I love tariffs. What they can do for you, income and protection, and even third-party things you can do just by the threat of tariffs. Because we're the pot of gold. We won't be the pot of gold long if we don't do something. So I was making a speech the other day in Detroit at the Economic Club, which is a great place, beautiful. And talking about cars, and I saw the man that is the great car factory builder who I know, John, I won't give his full name, but John. And I saw him and I said, ""Could I see you after the speech?"" I made the speech. I went to see him. I said, ""How are those plants coming, the big ones in China?"" They said, ""Sir, they just canceled them because they think you're going to get elected, and they don't want to build them because they won't be able to pay tariffs."" [cheers and applause]
We just canceled them. I didn't even do anything, and I just saved Detroit. I just saved every car-making state. No, but think of it. And I thought to myself, ""Just the threat of tariffs, they canceled these multi-billion dollar auto factories,"" auto machines is what they really are. Now, will I get credit for that? I don't think so, but we know. But he just said, ""Because of you, they think you're going to get elected. They think you're going to charge tariffs that are so much that it won't be possible for them to survive."" And China just canceled those big, beautiful factories that would've destroyed our country in terms of auto making. And I think it's great. And now people are starting to see it. They're saying, ""That was a pretty good thing to do."" I didn't even do anything. Just a mere threat of that beautiful word kept what we have.
Don't forget, a lot of it's been taken over 50, 60 years. We were the greatest powerhouse. We will have that back soon. I think we can compete with it. We will have that back soon. We're going to have so many auto plants and so many steel plants built in this country now. So simple too. [cheers and applause] It's so simple. And I've been talking about this for the last couple of months, and people are starting to understand it. They're starting to understand it. And China does it. They've been doing it for a long time. They say, ""We don't want your cars. If you want to build a car, you build it in our country.""
They did it with Harley Davidson in India. They charge a 200% tariff on a motorcycle. They said, ""If you want to do this, you have to build it. We don't want your motorcycles. We're going to charge you 200. Harley Davidson said, ""We don't sell any in India. Tariff's too high."" I said, ""What are you going to do?"" They said, ""We've got to build a plant over there, sir."" We're the only one that doesn't do it because we're ruled by corrupt and stupid politicians. But we're doing it now.
As we build our economy, we'll also restore our borders. For four straight years, Kamala has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails. They come from insane asylums and mental institutions and all around the world. They come from Venezuela to the Congo. They come from the Congo now. A lot of them are coming out of the jails of the Congo, and she's resettled them into our communities, to prey upon our innocent American citizens.
No, we're not going to do that. When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. We're not going to have it. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. And every day, Kamala is using migrant flights and her phone app. Do you believe they have a phone app for the criminal cartels to call up? ""Hello, this is Jose Rodriguez. I'd like to know where do I dispose of my illegal migrants?"" And they tell you where to drop them. Can you believe it? The only thing worse are the flights.
They have planes flying over our border, a big beautiful Boeing, 727, 737s, and just like that beautiful plane over there. Isn't it a pretty plane? [cheers and applause] 757, 767s, they have planes flying back and forth, loaded up with migrants only going one way, by the way, to flood Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, that's what they're doing, and the entire Midwest with thousands and thousands of illegal migrants. And many of these are very dangerous people. They'll look at you, they'll cut you up, and they won't even think about it. As just one example, the 4,000 person town of Charleroi, Pennsylvania has seen, listen to this, a 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants. Think of that, 2000% increase in the population of illegal migrants under Harris. She doesn't want to be called border czar, but you know what? I don't care. She was in charge of the border. This deficient, this mentally deficient president put her in charge of the border, and she never went there, not once. And she never—
When the border patrol last week endorsed me so strongly, I asked them, ""How often did you speak to her? You were dealing with her."" They said, ""Sir, we never spoke to her once."" I said, ""Who did she speak to?"" There were like 40 guys on the stage, all the leaders of the border patrol. She said, ""Not one of them did she speak to, not one."" Pennsylvania is not going to take it anymore. One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country is the savage Venezuelan Prison Gang Tren de Aragua. Has anyone heard of it? You've heard of MS-13 these are right in the same category. You don't get any meaner or tougher, but they're taking over apartment complexes—like I do. I'm in the real estate business also. Isn't it—They do it differently. They do it with guns. I do it with financing. And unleashing a violent terror spree all across America. This is happening all over. Let's watch.

[end of video]
TRUMP: And it's that way all over America. And I say it's a much bigger—The polls are saying that the biggest problem is inflation and the economy. I say that's a bigger problem. I'd move inflation and the economy to number two. That is a bigger problem because that's destroying the fabric of our country. The United States is now an occupied country, but November 5th, 2024 will be liberation day in America. It's going to be liberation day. [cheers and applause] Under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal alien convicted murders are on the loose right now in the United States of America. Can you believe it? Just this week, two illegal alien members of the same savage Venezuelan gang were arrested in New York for robbing, shooting, and murdering a 59-year-old man in a Connecticut hotel. One of these illegal alien monsters was a got-away. Do you know what that is? These are the illegal got-aways. And the other was caught, but then released into our country by Kamala Harris and her horrible, horrible free open borders. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause]
We have no choice. I don't want to do it. The record right now is Dwight Eisenhower, a moderate president that couldn't stand—He just couldn't stand what was happening with the border many years ago. Dwight Eisenhower, General Eisenhower, he was a good president, but he was a moderate person, but he has every record. He just couldn't stand watching the borders be crossed by people that weren't citizens of our country. I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them out of our country immediately. They will get sent back to where they came from. We have no choice. [cheers and applause]
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Can you believe that? We couldn't have an act like that now because now everything's woke. You know, we have woke generals like Milley and Mattis. We have woke people. They don't do things like this, so we had to go back to 1798 when we had real people running our country. The Alien Enemies Act of 17 gives us tremendous power to the President to do what's right, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. So when they come back, if they come back—When they hear that, they won't come back. And if that's not good enough, we'll make it 20. And I'm also calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, right? [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Kamala's invasion is also bankrupting Medicare and Social Security. She wants to give millions of illegals the benefits you work for your entire lives. And by the way, by talking about education, social security, all of the different benefits. That's why people are pouring up into our country. If you say you're not going to get it, they won't come. They're coming because we say, ""Come on up"" like that idiot governor from California, Gavin Newscum [sic] [booing], Gavin Newscum [sic]. Did you see the other day he signed a bill that you are not even allowed to ask a person whether or not they have voter ID. If you ask them, it's a criminal penalty. If you say, ""Sir, I'd like to see your voter ID,"" they want to put you in jail for saying that. We are not going to stand—I'm going to get that thing overturned so fast. He just signed the bill. Because we want, ultimately, one-day voting, we want paper ballots, we want voter ID, and we want proof of citizenship, and we're finished. [cheers and applause]
And we'll have quick fair elections that will cost 8% of the cost of these very beautiful fancy machines that go up to Mars and around and down and all over the place. You ever see this, where they have machines? We spend all this money in machines, and then they announce we expect to have the results like seven days after the election. If you had paper ballots, you get them at 10 o'clock. France went to paper because what we did didn't work. The mail-in ballots didn't work. France had them. And you know what? Didn't work. There was a lot of theft, a lot of things going on. They went to paper ballots, same-day voting, 38 million votes. Everything was done by 10 o'clock in the evening. No people complaining, nothing. I will protect, for a fraction—By the way, for a fraction of the cost. I will protect our seniors and ensure that federal benefits are for Americans only. I just want them to be only for Americans. Kamala is telling you if you vote for her, it's four more years of the same. Take a look.

[end of video] [booing]
TRUMP: That's it, right? She'd do nothing different than the worst administration in the history of our country? The happiest person in life, he just turned over 100 years old now, he's over 100, he turned a few weeks ago, Jimmy Carter, he's the happiest man around. You know why? Because he looks brilliant compared to this Administration. The Carter administration is brilliant compared to these people. He didn't destroy our country at the border.
Pennsylvania, if you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. You have to go and vote. Get everybody you can. And ladies and gentlemen, we can start really well. There's a man. I'm going to call him up real quickly. His name is David McCormick. He's really—he is a great man, been successful at everything. He's smart, he's tough. Everything he did turned out to be great, and I think this is going to be just the start. Vote for him for the Senate.
Your particular Senator right now is a total stiff. Thank you. Who says he's my best friend. He just announced he's for me with tariffs. I don't know the gentleman. This is the guy that's going to do it, David McCormick. [cheers and applause]
DAVID MCCORMICK: Thank you, Mr. President. Well, Mr. President, it all comes down to Pennsylvania. It all comes down to the Keystone state. We've got to put you back in the White House so we can have strength and common-sense policies to fight back on this crazy liberal agenda, the weakness of Kamala Harris that has taken us over the cliff. So we're with you Mr. President, 100%. We're going to fight for you, but we also got to get a majority in the Senate so we can put those common-sense policies in place. And that's why we got to retire Bob Casey, 30-year career politician. He's weak, and he's voted 100% with the crazy liberal agenda of Biden-Harris. We got to send Bob Casey home. And Mr. President, first time today, I just heard this an hour or two ago, good news, first public poll that says McCormick's in the lead over Casey. [cheers and applause] We're going to win this, but we need to fight, fight, fight for the next 17 days. No sleep. Take our country back. Thank you, Mr. President.
CROWD: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, David. David's a good man. And he's going to really represent you, and he's going to work with us on getting your taxes down, et cetera. We're also joined by representatives, John Joyce, great guy. Where's John? Hello, John. Dan Meuser, who's fantastic, my friend, all my friends, and Byron Donalds of Florida. [cheers and applause] And also, I tell you if you're a football fan, these guys are good. I guess they're going to the game a little bit later or something. Are you going to the game? Are you going or you're going to watch it on television? Former NFL stars, Antonio Brown—Oh, he was a good player. [cheers and applause] He was a good player. And Le'Veon Bell, really good players. And Mike Wallace. Come on up, fellas. Come on up.
ANTONIO BROWN: Let's vote for Trump, baby. Make some noise for the president. [cheers and applause]
LE'VEON BELL: Let's go Trump. You already know. Vote Trump. Let's go.
BROWN: [leading chant with crowd] Here we go, Steelers.
CROWD: Here we go.
BROWN: Here we go Steelers.
CROWD: Here we go.
BELL: Thank so much. See you tomorrow at the game.
TRUMP: Have a good time. Thank you.
MIKE WALLACE: Appreciate you.
TRUMP: They look good. We're also deeply honored to be joined by gold star family members of the service members, several of them who gave their lives in Afghanistan. So, so horrible, so horrible that this had to happen. They're friends of mine. Many of the families are friends of mine. I've gotten to know him over this, and it's just horrible. Should have never happened, would've never happened. Corporal Hunter Lopez and his family is here. We're honoring these people. [applause] Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover, Sergeant Nicole G., and Corporal Kareem Nikoui. Thank you very much. Great people. I got to know them very well. Should it never, ever happened. 13, 13 people and many, many so badly injured. We have to talk about them. I talk about them all the time with the legs and the arms and just obliteration. So I want to thank you all very much.
Thank you for being here. Thank you. I also want to thank Elon Musk, because when I called him on North Carolina and Georgia, as you know, they had almost no—Especially in North Carolina, they had no communication. The lines were all down a few weeks ago with Hurricane Helene. And I called Elon. They said, ""Do you know Elon Musk?"" I said, ""I happen to know him. What do you want?"" ""We need Starlink."" I said, ""What does Starlink? Tell me, please. Give me a lesson. Tell me."" And they told me, ""It's basically great communication, and up to a satellite and back."" And they said, ""We just have to have it. We can't get it because it's very hard to get."" And I called Elon and he had it there literally in moments. It was amazing how fast he got it there for them. So I want to thank Elon for doing that. That was great. [cheers and applause] People of North Carolina. So we're working very hard for Pennsylvania. But in breaking news, it was just announced that the highly respected Florida judge who is overseeing our case against the Pulitzer Prize Board for awarding their once highly respected prizes to the failing New York Times and the Washington Post. These are really fake news papers. Call them fake news papers, but they're fake news, Russia, Russia, Russia stories. They got the Pulitzer Prize for Russia, Russia, Russia. Turned out to be a fake story. So I figured, what the hell, on your behalf, I'd sue their off. [cheers and applause] And he's ordered discovery to move full speed ahead. He wants it to go. That means that we will be able to learn the full scale of their lies, deceit, and wrongdoing, and we'll hold these radical lunatics accountable for the lying that they've done to the American people. What they've done is incredible.
Think of it. They got the Pulitzer Prize for their great reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia, and then it turned out to be a hoax, and now everybody knows it. So I want them to return those Pulitzer Prizes, and I think lots of damages should be awarded to a lot of different people. [cheers and applause] So here are the facts. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than Bernie. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police, and anybody who wants to defund it could not be president of the United States. We cherish our police, and we're going to give them back their respect and their dignity and let them do the job, and crime will fall. Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. These are tough people. I know a lot of tough people right in this first few rows. They're not tough like these guys.
As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayers expense. She lied about working at McDonald's, a simple thing. I think very soon, maybe tomorrow or something, I'm going to work the French fry. [cheers and applause] I think so.
I think I'm doing it tomorrow, and I think it's in a place in Pennsylvania. And I'm going to stand over that French fry. She lied about her—It's a very basic thing to say. They'll say—Oh, look at all that press. That's lot of press. But they're going to say, ""Oh, it's so basic."" It is basic, but the basic is easier to understand. She said, as part of a resume, for years, I worked at McDonald's. It's probably tough, but she never worked there. It turned out to be a hoax. So on top of all of this, Kamala turned on our military and wants to make them woke. Take a look at our real military. Just take a look at it.

TRUMP: That wasn't exactly woke. So in conclusion—And thank you for being here, everybody. This is beautiful. [cheers and applause] We'll get you out real fast. We are you going to get you to go watch that game tonight, right? We really do appreciate this kind of crowd, and the love that we've had is incredible. But with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris. We are going to save America. We're going to rebuild our nation for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. With your support, we will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We'll cut your taxes, demolish inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and turn the United States into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will hire American, buy American, build American, and show the whole world that the American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. And I'm the one that can do it. I'm the only one that's going to do it. [cheers and applause]
I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, and resources. And we have to give them respect again. We're going to give them respect like they've never had. And they're going to get rid of crime, and they'll get rid of it quickly and efficiently. We cannot live with the kind of crime that we're living with in our country today. We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt our military, and now we're going to modernize it still further. We will build a missile defense shield all made in the USA, including the Commonwealth is going to build a lot of it. We're entitled to it. We're entitled to it. Others have it. We want it too. And we will land an American astronaut on Mars. Get ready, Elon. Get ready. We got to land, and we got to do it quickly. But a lot of that has to do with military, the space.
I created Space Force, and it's going to go down. In my opinion, it's just about the most important with time of the forces. We were way behind Russia and China, and now we're leading them by a lot. It's a great thing, Space Force. First time in 82 years since Air Force that this happened. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will immediately keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause]
I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our second amendment. And we'll end sanctuary cities and stop illegal immigration once and for all. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. After years of building up foreign countries, defending foreign borders, and protecting foreign lands, we will finally be going to build our country, defend our borders, and protect our American cities, suburbs, and towns. We will protect them like they have never been protected before. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. They're doing. This is an invasion into our country of a foreign military. We will be free and proud as a nation again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day we'll be filled with opportunity and hope.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda once and for all. It will happen, will happen. We want a landslide that's too big to rig. So early voting is underway. Get everyone and vote. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. These will be four of the greatest years in the history of our country, and it's going to happen quickly. With your help, from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise, and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never back down, ever, ever, ever, and we will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight. We will vote, vote, vote, and we will win, win, win like we have never won before. [cheers and applause]
November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless you. [cheers and applause]

    CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much. You know, over the years I've had and heard that song sung by others, and you know, honestly, it's not the same. This man just sings it in a way that nobody else can sing that particular song, and it's become so popular, like in some circles, the most popular song of its kind. I just want to thank Lee. He's been with us from the beginning. Really a talented, unique guy, and a good person with a great family. So thank you very much, Lee. We appreciate it very much. [cheers and applause]
And a very special hello to North Carolina. [cheers and applause] I don't know if my boy told you, but Laura and Eric have two beautiful children. One of them happens to be named Carolina, so that's pretty good. That means you like the place pretty much, huh? So it's great, but it's also great to be back in this incredible state with so many proud American patriots who believe in faith and family, God, and country. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause]
We need more of that in this nation, don't we? We need more of that. We'd be a much different place right now, because right now it's not doing well. Right now, we're a failing nation, but we will soon be a great nation again.
Earlier today, I visited Western North Carolina and witnessed the terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene. I was actually here about a week and a half ago right after, but I didn't want to come into certain sections, because I wanted to let them do their job. Our federal government, as you know, and FEMA has really let them down, especially in North Carolina. It's a shame. They spent a lot of money on having illegal people come into our country, migrants. You've heard about it. There wasn't a lot of money for the people of North Carolina or a lot of the people from a lot of other states that were also devastated by that monster. That was a monster storm.
But so many people have come together and done an incredible job, including Franklin Graham, who's been amazing. [cheers and applause] To every family who has lost a loved one, a home, our hearts are with you, and we're praying for you. The homes are bad, but family members are really bad. That's a tough one. It's something you can never shake that, but all I can do is say, we love you and we're with you 100 percent. And on January 20th, if we win this election, I always like to say ""if,"" and people say, ""Oh, please say when,"" but you know, we have to understand that bad things can happen, but we're not going to let it happen. We're never going to let it happen again. We're doing really well. We're leading. I know nobody in this room gambles, but some of the gambling polls are really in there, like 65 to 35 or something like that, I saw one. But nobody here gambles.
Does anybody in this room? No, no, no, no, no. Great Christians don't gamble, do they? Oh, no. So we're doing really well, I would say beyond our wildest expectations, and that's not only in polls. More particularly, it's in the votes that are being cast. They're coming in at levels that we've never seen. One of the things that's amazing is North Carolina, so it was devastated, devastated, and yet areas that were the worst, the worst areas, we just left one, as you know, and I met some of the greatest people, but they just set a record for votes cast thus far, and their homes are gone. [cheers and applause] I mean, it's an amazing, amazing thing. I figured maybe you'd get 50%, and these are, they call it Trump country, and I'm very honored by that. But these are Trump people, and just think of that; their homes have gone, they've gone through such hell, and it's as big a water storm, they say, as we've ever seen in this country.
And they just set a record. They compared it to the two elections previous, and we have a substantial number more. Can you imagine that? I mean, those are great, great people. Thank you very much. [cheers and applause] I want to thank a very special man, Ben Carson, Dr. Ben Carson, for organizing this, and of course Candy [Carson], because without Candy, I don't know if Ben would be the same. I don't think so, actually. That's a special couple, but can I tell him the one quick little story where you told me a couple of times? But Ben was very tough to beat, actually. He was getting up, up, up, and other people were falling in the wrong direction, because he was in a primary with me, the original primary. And one day in a church, it was a Sunday morning and he was doing well, really well, and in a church, he came over to him and he said, ""You know you're going to win, don't you?""
I said, ""What's this all about?"" Because he's a tough competitor. I said, ""What is this all about?"" He said, ""God has picked you to win."" [cheers and applause] Can you believe that? Right? And you have no idea. It was so tough for him to say that.
I said, ""This is really something,"" and he really was. He is something. People love him, and they loved him then, and they even love him more now. He went to HUD, which is a, I must say, it's always mired in scandal. People, you're giving out a lot of money and there's a lot of bad things happen when you're giving out all that money, and Ben went four years. Perfection. I don't know. [applause] Has it ever happened before? Has it ever happened before? I wasn't surprised, but a lot of people were surprised. Anytime you get through that one for four years, you have to be one honest gentleman. But he ran it really great, and he's a special man and he's done a special job today, and it's my honor to be here. Thank you very much, and thank you, Ben and Candy, very much. Appreciate it. That's some story though, isn't it Ben, huh? Candy? I love that story.
I'd also like to thank somebody that's done unbelievable things, and especially in very hard times. I've seem to—When I was president and I would go to a lot of the sites, the tornadoes, the tornadoes of vicious, they ask, ""Which are the worst, the tornadoes, the hurricanes, the tsunamis?"" And I have a friend, that's what he does. He studies this. I said, ""So what's the worst?"" He actually said, ""Tsunami. The ocean just lifts up, and a lot of bad things happen, in terms of the level,"" but they're all bad in their own way, but I've been with Franklin Graham through a lot of them, and we're very happy to have helped them out during the course of most of them, and maybe in particular, this one. This was so sad to see such a great part of our country and so devastating. When you looked at the size of that storm, that hurricane, it covered the whole state of Florida, practically. Normally, you see a little trough through it or hitting one area, but you'd look at the map, and you look at the whole state of Florida was covered in one form or another. Franklin Graham just is a special, special person with a great family.
And his father wasn't too bad either, right? [cheers and applause] You know, my father used to take me to Yankee Stadium. He loved Billy Graham, and he would take me as a young guy. He would take me to Yankee Stadium. He thought Billy Graham was great, and I'll tell you what. Billy Graham is looking down, and he's very proud of his son and his family. I can tell you that, without question. [cheers and applause]
Pastor Paula White, I've known for a long time. She is so unbelievable, what she's done for the campaign. She's just organized everything. Everybody respects her. She'll call meetings, and everybody shows up. Even if it's two hours later, they'll get here. She's just a very incredible woman. What she's done with evangelicals, what she's done with, actually, people of all faiths, it's, what she's done really has made a big difference. We get 88% of the vote.
People would say, ""Wow, that's not bad. 88%,"" and they said, ""How did you do that?"" I said, ""Would you please speak to Paula White?"" Because she knew what she was doing, and we have a team of pastors, ministers, and even rabbis, where they like what I've done for Israel. I can tell you that. We have a lot of rabbis. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Where is Paula? Where is Paula? She was right behind me before. She's probably working. That's what she does, but Paula, she's here someplace. She's right back there. She's making phone calls, getting more people lined up for the vote. I'd rather have her do that than be here. But that's the kind of person she is. She's fantastic, and Scott Turner, who was in the administration. Scott, where's Scott? Come on, Scott. This guy, a great person, a great everything, great athlete, and a very fine man, and you really did something very special for the administration. We really appreciate it, and get ready, get ready. Just keep yourself in good shape. We don't have to worry about his shape, I can tell you that, but we appreciate it, Scott.
Thank you very much. And a beautiful speaker, boy. He got up, and he would talk to groups of people and they were so jazzed up. They could do anything. He was very special, and a person, I have to say, the most special. We have to say has been the most special of them all because he's my son. You know? [cheers and applause] I mean—I'm saying how can he be more special than Ben Carson? But Ben, do you mind if I say, he's my son? Am I allowed to say just slightly more special? Oh, you're tied. Let's call it a tie, okay? But Eric has been amazing in business, and everything he has done has been so incredible. He has become a legend in the legal profession because he's the most subpoenaed human being in history. [laughing] He's gotten more subpoenas than any human being in history. Every day, Congress, ""This one and that one, deranged Jack Smith."" We had people, the likes of which nobody, you talk about weaponization of government, what they've done is incredible.
And he's cool as a cucumber. ""Yeah, dad. We got another couple of subpoenas today."" ""Where'd they come from?"" ""Congress. This one, that one."" And crazy Nancy Pelosi would send them like it's cookies. [laughing] She had subpoenas on the corner of her desk, and congressmen would just walk in and grab a subpoena, write it, and send it. I'd say, ""Yeah, Eric. Handle it."" He became very proficient. He's a great, young man and he really is very excited about today. Did he do a good job when he spoke? [cheers and applause] No, he's great. He's great. He's got a lot of talent, a lot of talent. And also here is my daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Michael. And Tiffany is pregnant, going to have a baby. [cheers and applause] She's going to have a baby, and is going to be a, I am not allowed to say what the baby is going to be, am I? I don't know. I'm not going to put her on the spot. I'm not going to say it. I'm not taking a chance. I don't want to see her have a long face, ""Dad, you shouldn't have said that, dad.""
But she's been, from day one, she was a great student, and she went to a fantastic law school, graduated number one in her class, [cheers and applause] and we couldn't be happier. I mean, I've just never had a problem with her. I shouldn't say. We better knock on wood. Where's some wood around here? That's one piece of wood. Most of it is plastic. But she has been, she's been an amazing person, and her husband's doing a great job. And thank you, Michael, for the job you're doing. Appreciate it. Congratulations though.
And Linda McMahon, who most of you know, she headed up small business for the government. Now, small business is giant business. When you add it all up, it's about as big—I think it's probably bigger than any bank in the world, and she was one of our great people in the administration and a very, very successful woman. She was very generous, I know, with Franklin and with the work done here, she was really very generous and she's always generous. She's been generous to the campaign but we're very proud of her. Linda, wherever you may be? Where are you, Linda? Linda? Linda? [cheers and applause] Thank you, Linda. Thank you, thank you. An incredible woman.
And a friend of mine also, Steve Witkoff, who's a very successful man and he is—Where is Witkoff? He is somebody that's been also very—He wrote a big check for Franklin to take care of a place called North Carolina and so we like him. Even if we didn't like him, we like him, right? Steve Witkoff. Thank you, Steve, very much.
And Peter Navarro, I heard he gave a great speech and Peter is—Peter took a lot of abuse, talk about weaponization. And do I see my favorite person here? Will you please stand up? What's this all about? Stand up. Wow. Thank you, darling. Right from the beginning, right? Right from the beginning, from day one, thank you very much. Thank you very much, [inaudible], appreciate it. And thank you to every pastor, patriot, and faith leader here today, we have so many. We have so many people, I'm—This is the worst is, when you introduce some, you're in trouble. Because I'm seeing six, seven people, I get a lot of people that—I see a group of two over there, I'm in trouble but let's get on with it. Do you mind? Let's get on because, with your help, we're going to make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much.
So, I was introduced to church at a very early age and I had a wonderful church, actually, in Jamaica, Queens, First Presbyterian Church. I don't know if you know it, it was built a long time ago and it was great. But very early and then, ultimately, on Sundays, my parents Fred and Mary would drive me into Manhattan to worship at Marble Collegiate Church where Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the author of one of the really big bestsellers, ""The Power of Positive Thinking,"" he was the head pastor, great book. It was a great book then and a great book now. Power of Positive Thinking, a lot of people could use a little positive thinking, right? And he was an incredible speaker. My sister and I were both married there and the funeral services for both of my parents, I mean, my mom and dad were—They took place in the main sanctuary of Marble Collegiate Church and it was just always very special.
I still remember the great sermons of Norman Vincent Peale and he truly was one of the greatest speakers I've ever—First, he was a believer but he was also a great speaker, unbelievable man. I actually saw his last sermon but, when you left church, you were really disappointed that it was over. I can't—I have to say, I know we have a lot of pastors and ministers but sometimes it's like—Am I allowed to say that? It's like a Biden, you know? [cheers and applause] Sometimes, not often, of course. But this man—And he always preached in sort of modern times, a little bit in modern times, he'd bring it up, I remember. I remember so many of his sermons but he talked about Alfred Sloan who was the founder of General Motors and how he grew up and how he had tremendous problems with alcohol and he became a major alcoholic. And then you know, Norman Vincent Peale would just say, ""And then one day he met God,"" and he would just—The expression of this man. He used to stand at a podium and he'd always be like this [steps away from podium], just like that and he'd preach and you really were, you were disappointed when it was over.
He'd tell you stories about God, about many things, about life. It was really stories about life and how it pertained to religion and it was really amazing. And he was amazing and a brilliant—Just the enthusiasm he had. And I listened to him for, I would say, 20 years and then, one day, I went to church, Marble Collegiate, and he was now, I guess, in his 90s and he was preaching and you could see he was getting a little bit tired and he stood just like I said, right over here to the left of the podium and he said, ""I can't do this anymore."" That was it and he just sat down, we all understood. He was just—He was really—No, he was really—It was his last time at the podium and the last time he preached and it was an amazing moment and everybody just stood up and applauded, it was sort of a beautiful thing to watch actually. But to see him, because he was truly a very big name at the time and very respected and the fact that he wrote this book that was such a big bestseller, it was a massive bestseller. Still is, I think. But as I look back at my life's journey and events, I now recognize that it's been the hand of God leading me to where I am today. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
CROWD MEMBER: Amen.
TRUMP: And my faith took on new meaning on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania where I was knocked to the ground essentially by what seemed like a supernatural hand and I would like to think that God saved me for a purpose and that's to make our country greater than ever before. [cheers and applause]
Thank you. Thank you very much. And that is something. Eric is a great shooter, great. If he were a golfer, he'd be a plus four. He's a great shooter and so is Don, they're both great shooters, they know a lot about guns. In fact, I think I got the blessing of the NRA because of my sons. Early on, I remember I was running against a lot of people that had good gun credentials, and 2016, and the NRA, which was in its full bloom actually, they even spent $35 million on the campaign but I think they did it because of my sons because they beat out a lot of very good people that believed in that whole world, little different world but that whole world because of Don and Eric. But when they both heard what had happened that day at Butler, they said, ""How far was it?"" and I said it was 130 yards and they knew the weapon and they said, ""I can't believe it,"" because—Eric actually said a bad shooter would hit you every single time and I didn't realize it to that extent.
I made that right-hand turn and I made it a little quickly and that got me in a position where it just psshh [sic]. Not a good feeling but much better than the alternative. [laughing] It wasn't the best feeling. And it was a bloody sucker, I will tell you that. I didn't realize but the doctor told me, he told me a couple of things, he said, ""You're the luckiest man I've ever seen."" He said, ""I've been doing this for 25 years,"" and he said, ""Sir, I'd like to suggest that you go out right now and buy a lottery ticket because this is a good day."" [laughing] But Eric told me and Don told me that—I think they became more religious that day because they said that was amazing that we could have survived something like that. An eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch away so it's pretty amazing.
CROWD MEMBER: Praise God.
TRUMP: And if we didn't make—Thank you. And if we didn't make—Thank you very much. If we didn't make the turn, that wouldn't have happened. And I made the turn to show a chart which became my all-time favorite chart in the history of the world. [cheers and applause] My all-time favorite, I sleep with that chart, I kiss that chart. [laughing] But we're 15 days away from the most important election in the history of our country and, if you want to know what is at stake for Christians in this race, just listen to what Kamala Harris had to say last week. Because when two college students, religious college students and very good people, everybody said what wonderful young men they were and are, at a campaign stop, she heard shouting from the background Jesus is Lord-
CROWD MEMBER: Jesus is Lord.
TRUMP: Jesus is Lord. And Kamala Harris ridiculed them, mocked them, and told them they were, quote, ""You're at the wrong rally. Get the""—She basically said get out but I won't say that because people didn't hear that so much but then she said you're at the wrong rally. And that's really what she meant, that's really what she meant. She's very destructive to religion, she's very destructive to Christianity and very destructive to evangelicals and to the Catholic Church. And she's, let me put it this way, Ben, she is your worst nightmare, much worse than Biden and he wasn't so hot. [laughing] But while Kamala says that people who believe in Jesus don't belong to her rallies, you have to remember that that's as loud as it can be. In fact, a lot of people said that would be disqualifying for her, that would be a disqualification. In our movement, we love Christians, we welcome believers and we embrace followers of Jesus. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you.
CROWD: JESUS! JESUS! JESUS!
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Boy, this is a lively group, Ben. This is a very lively group you've assembled. What's going on with Ben? This is something, Ben. But at Trump rallies, we don't tell Christians to get lost, we tell Christians to get out and vote. [cheers and applause]
You don't have the choice of sitting out this election because, if Kamala Harris gets four more years, the radical left is not going to leave Christians alone, it's going to get worse and worse and you're going to suffer greatly. They will come after Christians all over the country, Kamala Harris has vowed to abolish the filibuster, letting her pack the Supreme Court and I even heard as many as 25 justices. The Supreme Court with Marxist radicals, with people that we don't want on the Supreme Court to rewrite the Constitution and to overrule your values. I think one of the greatest things I've done is the Supreme Court and also getting over 300 judges appointed throughout our land that have made a tremendous difference. [applause] Those 300 judges have made a tremendous difference. She'll flood our country with tens of millions more illegal aliens and make them all citizens cancelling out your voting power forever. Kamala will mandate that every public school in America must promote the idea that children can change their genders [booing], allow men into girls' locker room, and also allow men to play in women's sports. [booing] Can you imagine that, men in women's sports?
And it's such a strong movement by, I believe, really, a very, very small group of people. Because you know, it's interesting, I haven't met one person that thinks that's a good idea and yet it's a movement, but I've never met anybody. Now, I don't know everybody but I haven't met anybody that wants it. And even the young ladies that are afraid of what's happening, you saw the other day the volleyball player who was hit very hard on the head by a ball, a smash that—In fact, I saw this person, a person who transitioned hit the ball. I mean, that ball was moving as fast as the ball can move and she said I've never seen anything like it, really whacked her. But some people were put out of commission just in volleyball, let alone other sports. But when you look at weightlifting, how about that one? Or you look at swimming records, track records, it's so demeaning to women, it's so ridiculous, it's so demeaning. [cheers and applause]
But Kamala will force doctors and parents to allow sex changes and genital-mutilation of minor children, that's what they do. She has it literally where sex change operations for people in detention, when they were being held in detention, if they wanted a sex change operation, she said, ""Yes, I approve it."" Who would do this? Who would do this?
And you know, I'm talking about everything else but I'm also talking it's an extremely difficult operation and a very expensive operation but who would do this and who would want this? And between that, she was the head of the movement defund the police. You have to understand, she's a radical left Marxist and a lot of people want to know what does that mean? She's a person so far left like nobody's seen in the Senate in many, many years. But the main thing is she's not a very bright person either, that's a dangerous—That's a really dangerous combination. Your religious liberty will be gone, your free speech will be gone, your Second Amendment will be gone and parental rights will be gone forever. So, I'm here tonight to deliver a simple message to Christians across America, it's time to stand up and save your country. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Thank you very much, thank you very much.
CROWD MEMBER: Vote Trump!
TRUMP: On November 5th, Christian voters need to turn out in the largest numbers ever. Do you know that, if you did that—Because you have a reputation of not voting proportionately like you should, you do know that. I think that maybe it's a form of rebellion, could that be possible? The two groups, not to equate them, but they are probably associated in some form but Christians, Evangelicals but Christians and gun owners, gun owners don't vote. They vote but very small proportions. If they did or if Christians did, nobody could ever beat us, nobody. So, I hope that we're going to get numbers like we haven't seen you. Remember, this is your last day, today is your last day of registration, you have to remember that. And so, if you want to leave right now, go, I won't be insulted. Leave right now and go and register but this is your last day.
So, we need to tell Kamala Harris that we've had enough. Kamala, you've been the worst vice president, you're a member of the worst administration in the history of our country. The happiest person around is Jimmy Carter [laughing] because Jimmy Carter is considered a brilliant president by comparison to crooked Joe Biden. Jimmy Carter is brilliant, his administration will go down as a brilliant administration compared to Crooked Joe. But we're going to say, Kamala, you've done a horrible job, you're a horrible vice president, there's no way you're going to be our president. Kamala, you are fired. Get out. Out, out, out. [cheers and applause] Right?
For four straight years, I fought for Christians like no president has ever fought before, you know that. I protected the religious freedom of doctors, nurses, teachers, and faith groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor, oh, I fought for them. I blocked the IRS, they were coming after everybody. They still are, I guess, to an extent but now they are because of this administration. But I blocked the IRS from using the Johnson Amendment to interfere with pastors' freedom of speech. We want to hear from our pastors, we don't want them to be shy. Where they take away your tax-exempt status because a pastor mentioned something that's slightly political and I ended it, Kamala Harris has taken it away and we're not—I'll tell you what, if she has taken your right away, I gave that to you and they took it back but we're going to give it back to you within the first week. [cheers and applause] I'd like to make it the first day but it'll take me a little while. So, we're going to give it back to you, within the first week, you're going to have that right because we want to hear from these people. There aren't too many people I want to hear from but you I do want to hear from.
So, we're going to give you back within the first week and Paula will make sure that that takes place, I will not disappoint you. I appointed 300 judges to interpret the law and the Constitution as written [applause] and withstood the vicious attacks to confirm three great Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.[cheers and applause] And they're great and they're courageous. They're courageous and they're brilliant but they are courageous. What they have to endure with the radical left and all of the things that they have to listen to, I actually think it's illegal what people do. They call it playing the ref. You know playing the ref? They'll say horrible things hoping that the three but also judges, they play the ref with judges, the great Bobby Knight basketball. He used to scream at the referee, he would scream like nobody ever screamed before. Indiana, he was a great guy, he backed me early on. He said, ""You're going to win."" I said, ""Well, I don't know, Bobby."" He said, ""Yeah, you're going to win, I have no doubt."" He said, ""I want this guy named Trump to run for president.""
I didn't know him. I called him up to thank him, he said, ""You're going to win. All you have to do is say it, you got to run."" And he was a tough cookie. Just died recently but he had the last undefeated team in college basketball. He won two or three national championships, he was a great coach and he never had the great—He had a couple, I guess, great players but he never had that real player that some teams have, he just did it with team. But he would scream at the referees, they called it playing the ref and they'd say, ""Bobby, Bobby, you got to stop. Bobby, don't do it, you're not going to win this call. You're not going to win it, it's over."" He said, ""No, but I'm going to win the next call,"" and it's true. They'd knock the hell out of somebody and the referee was afraid to call it, it's true. He was a master.
But they do that, they play the ref. They start screaming about the judge is no good and this one's no good and they're slow and they're lousy judges and the judge should be impeached and all of this crap when you have a brilliant judge that's doing the right thing and they get—And some people will fold a little bit, they'll say, ""Hey, I'll get them off my back, let me just give a bad ruling here or there,"" and some will do that actually. But fortunately, most have courage and they understand. I really believe it's illegal what they do and I know there's some great lawyers in there and we're going to look at it because what they do is so obvious, what they've done to the Supreme Court, even with the protection of their houses—You're not supposed to be allowed to march in front. They didn't stop it. You're not allowed to do any of these things that are happening. But they're playing the ref and they're playing it with judges and justices and they shouldn't be allowed to do it. And I believe it's illegal. I issued guidance making clear that the right to freedom of worship does not end at the door to a public school. [cheers and applause] We took care of it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
And I stood proudly with our friend and ally, the state of Israel. I kept my promise, recognized Israel's eternal capital, and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem and I actually got it built. I actually got it built. But many presidents—many, many presidents before me said—They campaigned on doing that and then they didn't do it. And I understand why, because when I got into office, I was called by people, heads of state, highest level. I was called by kings and prime ministers. I was called by everybody, ""Don't do it. Don't do it."" And then they heard I was going to do it, and they all called me and I said, ""Just do me a favor."" I shouldn't say this because little white—What do you call it? Yeah, I wasn't available.
I said, ""Just tell 'em I won't be available but I'll call—"" This I think was a Thursday. I said, ""I'll call you back on Monday,"" to kings, to the biggest people from the biggest countries, most powerful countries. And I said, ""I'll call you back."" And then on Thursday I announced it. I said, ""We are going to do exactly what a lot of people didn't want me to do."" They said there'd be bloodshed and everything else all over. There was none. And I did something that no other president had the courage to do. And then on Monday I called them back, ""Hi, how have you been?"" [laughing] ""I tried getting you. I wasn't able to, but you've already done it."" So we made Jerusalem the capital. [cheers and applause] And that brought a lot of—Did you know that?
That was something I didn't know, but I understood why other presidents were—I mean, every single person that campaigned for decades and decades, every president said they were going to do it, none of them did it. I did it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights was a big deal. [cheers and applause] The Golan Heights, that's another thing. 72 years, people would come in and leave, come in and leave. They'd meet every year, every two years about the Golan Heights. And I spoke with David Friedman. I said, ""Give me a lesson in five minutes or less on the Golan Heights,"" and he did. Talked about how important it was strategically, before all of the modern equipment and radar and all of that that we have now. But it was unbelievably important from a military—Because it was the highest point in the Middle East. And I did that.
And nobody even asked for that because they thought that would be a bridge too far. But I did that for Israel, and I was the first and only president to convene a meeting at the United Nations to end religious persecution worldwide. [cheers and applause] Nobody's done what I've done in terms of religion, in terms of Christianity, but in terms of religion, nobody's done what I did. And we did all of this and much more in four short years. And I will keep on fighting for our cherished American values when we become the 47th President of the United States. [cheers and applause] Thank you.
Under Kamala Harris, you've seen the Department of Justice target parents at school board meetings. Have you ever seen anything like it? They're like the enemy. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. These great people, they just want their children to be treated reasonably well. And the FBI would send spies into Catholic churches. If—I don't know how many Catholics are here, but if you're Catholic, there is no way you can be voting for these people. These people are a nightmare. I don't know what they have against Catholics, but Catholics are treated worse than anybody. So, and by the way, evangelicals are next. You can bet on it. Evangelicals are next. But they label Catholics as potential domestic terrorists. And the fact is that they'll be coming after you soon. These people are sick. These people are very sick people. Christians will not be safe with Kamala Harris as President of the United States.
It's not even thinkable. She's going to deal with President Xi of China. I don't think so. I know him very well. He's a very fierce man. Putin, all of these people, I know him all very well and we'll end up in Third World War because they have no idea. They have no idea. We're not going to have a Third World War. But if they get in, I think that we will have a Third World War out of stupidity, out of absolute stupidity. Think of it. Putin would've never, ever attacked Ukraine if I were president. All of those people that are now dead would not be dead. [applause] All of those cities that are knocked to the ground with those magnificent domed towers that are laying on the side, shattered into a million pieces, all of that would be up right now. You take a look at those cities, they've been bombed, they've been—There's nothing standing. There's literally not a building standing in many of them.
As soon as I take the oath of office, I will stop Kamala Harris weaponization of law enforcement against Americans of faith. We're going to do it. We're going to do it. [cheers and applause] Did you ever notice—So it's Kamala Harris. Nobody knows who the hell Harris is, right? Do you ever say, ""And we're going to stop Harris,"" they all go, ""Who's Harris?"" It's a weird thing. You think your name would be—But isn't it true nobody knows who Harris is, so we'll call her Kamala. It's a weird thing. Lots of strange things take place in politics, don't they? But I will create a new federal task force on fighting anti-Christian bias. That'll be done immediately. [cheers and applause] And I think it's very important for the people in this room to know, like Dr. Ben Carson knows, Americans of faith are not a threat to our country. Americans of faith are the soul of our country, right? [cheers and applause]
I will once again appoint rock-solid pro-constitutional judges to faithfully interpret the law and the constitution. The 300 judges that we appointed changed the whole—I mean, it was so bad. It was so bad what was happening out there. And these are great people, and they're fair people, and they do the right thing. We believe in the First Amendment rights of freedom of worship and freedom of speech. [applause] And I will deliver universal school choice, empowering every parent to send their child to the public, private, charter, or religious school that is right for them. [cheers and applause] And I will allow homeschool parents to spend ten thousand dollars a year tax-free on costs associated with their children's education. [cheers and applause]
Under the Trump administration, we will return patriotic education to our schools. That's okay. That's a good thing. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris supports the 1619 Project. [booing] Think of that. She supports it strongly. That teaches children to hate their country, that's what it does. The 1619 Project was condemned by every historian, and yet, Kamala, Harris's administration tried to push it into schools all across America. She fought very hard for that. She also fought very hard for the people that burned down Minneapolis, that were literally at war in Minnesota with one of the worst governors. I cannot believe this guy's a governor. Can you imagine him as a president? He's a wackadoo. [laughing]And by the way, how good did JD Vance do in exposing him? [cheers and applause]
They lie about everything. You know, they were going today—Every single thing they say, it's the opposite. Project 2025, Trump loves it. He loves it. He loves—They just say it. I've totally disavowed. A group of people went and I don't know what they did. I said specifically—I refused to read it. But every time they get up, they say everything that I've disavowed, they go on again and again and again. And the radical left people that are listening to them just let them talk. And they know it's all a big lie, but they just lie. I've never seen anything like it. I've had some political opponents before. Even crooked Hillary didn't lie like these people. And she lied a lot. But these people are going—I actually think they're choking because I watched today every single thing that I've said, ""No, no, no,"" they say, ""he said yes, yes, yes,"" like point after point. And no, there's something going on in their heads. Perhaps it's Trump derangement syndrome. [cheers and applause]
It's horrible. Or perhaps they know they're losing because we're doing very well. They know how well we're doing even the fake news. And that's a lot of fake news back there, Ben. [booing] The fake news knows—The fake news knows how well we're doing. Isn't it sad that we have to rely on the gambling—? The gamblers are the ones that are the only ones that want to say it. They're the ones—65%. No, no, they know. But we're going to just let it wait. And I really think we're going to have maybe one of the greatest victories in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] History of our country.
On day one, I will sign an executive order banning schools from promoting critical race theory or transgender insanity. [cheers and applause] I will take historic action to defeat the toxic poison of gender ideology and reaffirm that God created two genders, male and female. [cheers and applause] I will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will sign a law banning child sexual mutilation in all 50 states, won't happen anymore. [cheers and applause] And we will proudly say Merry Christmas again. On day one, I will stop the migrant invasion. We will be begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. [cheers and applause] I will end inflation and we will make America affordable again.
We will quickly become energy independent again. You know we were energy independent just four years ago. And we will frack, frack, frack, and drill, baby, drill. [cheers and applause] And I will cut energy prices in half within 12 months from January 20th, the day you assume the office of president because we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country, including Russia and including Saudi Arabia. We were third and maybe even fourth when I got in there. When I left, we were number one in energy production. And we did things that were amazing. We would've right now been four times higher than we were. We would've been making money, paying down debt. We would've been in a position that you wouldn't believe. But they decided to do it a different way. It's terrible. Wind. They put wind all over the place. Wind kills you birds. And if you want to watch television and the wind isn't blowing, you can forget it. [laughing]
"" Darling, let's watch the President tonight."" ""I'm sorry, Esther. But the wind isn't blowing. We won't be able to watch."" It's not exactly the most reliable source, but it is something. It's the most expensive source by far. I will end the war in Ukraine, stop the chaos in the Middle East, and prevent World War III. [cheers and applause] I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect they so dearly deserve. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive. And every day we will be filled with opportunity and hope. We will again have the American dream for our children.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda. We have to stop it once and for all. We want a landslide that is too big to rig, too big to rig. [cheers and applause] Early voting is underway so you know what you have to do. So Christians, get everyone you know and vote. You have to vote or we're not going to have the life that we should have, a life of prosperity and hope, a life of beauty. We're not going to have it. We're going to be fighting for our lives. These people have—They mean serious business. They've—they've—I honestly believe in many cases they're sick. And we cannot let this happen because it was our religion that kept our country together for many years. It was our religion that kept it together. And they're trying to take that away and they're trying to destroy our country. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years of the history of our country.
With your help from now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. [cheers and applause] November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country and together we will make America powerful again. [cheers and applause] We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much. God bless you all. God bless you all. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.

    TRUMP: Wow, thank you very much, everybody. Oh, this is a nice crowd. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Well, a very, very special hello to Greensboro. Hello Greensboro. [cheers and applause] And another hello to North Carolina, because I've been at North Carolina a lot lately, you probably see. I followed that horrible storm and then I came back and we spent a lot of time here yesterday. I met some incredible people. What they've done is unbelievable. They haven't had much help from our government in Washington, I can tell you that. [booing] But come January 20th when you take office you're going to be seeing a lot of me. [cheers and applause] We're going to fix it up and make it better than ever. And I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. And that's what you are. And I'd like to begin by asking a question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?
CROWD: NO!
TRUMP: I don't think so. I don't think so. So I'm here today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote this election I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country. [cheers and applause] And I will bring back, as your president, the American dream. We're going to bring it back. Our country is being crippled and destroyed by Kamala Harris—[booing] but it does not have to be this way. It won't be this way for long, hopefully what we've put up with, with the two of them. What we put up with the two of them with your support on November 5th, America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. [cheers and applause] This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure, and disaster, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. We'll do something that nobody will even believe. [cheers and applause] After all of the catastrophes that she has caused. Kamala, Kamala, ayayay [sic]. She can't say one thing. Not one thing did she'd do differently. They said, ""Would you do anything differently?"" ""Well, I can't really think of anything."" She's terrible. We need smart people. Now it's time for smart people. Not time for these people. [cheers and applause]
So I'm asking you to be excited about the future of our country again. And this will be America's new Golden Age. We're going to turn it around so fast your head will spin. Going to stop all of this craziness. [cheers and applause] Every problem facing us can be solved. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands in North Carolina. You have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala Harris that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. We're not going to take it anymore. You're the worst vice president in the history of our country. And you're aligned with the worst president in the history of our country, who by the way likes me more than he likes her. But I won't say that. Kamala, you're fired. Get out, Kamala. Get out. Get out. [cheers and applause]
No, I think she probably does. I think he likes me slightly more. He hates me. You know, but when you think of what happened to him, think about it. He was doing okay and then he had sort of a bad debate and his numbers went down a little bit. And that's to be expected. And then they went to him and they really just took the presidency away from him. And he's got a lot of anger in his heart. He's got a lot of hatred in his heart. And much of it goes to her, because she was the first one out. She failed. 22 people who going for the Democrat nomination, right, and she was the first one. Think of it, she was the first one out and now they're a threat to democracy as they like to say. ""They're a threat to democracy."" But nobody would've thought that was possible.
And now she's cratering in the polls. You know, you see it, because they're learning who she is. She's a radical left lunatic. Yesterday I was here in North Carolina, outside Asheville where I witnessed the terrible devastation of Hurricane Helene. To every family who was lost a loved one or a home or they lost so much. Our hearts are with you and we are praying for you. The polls are open for early voting in North Carolina. And every day from now until November 2nd. And then on November 5th, oh. [cheers and applause] If you think about it, that has a chance to be the biggest day in American history. That could be a very exciting day. It's going to be the most important election in American history. I really believe it, because our country has lost its way. We are a failing nation. I don't like saying that, but we are indeed a failing nation. What a nice crowd this is. [cheers and applause] Wow, a lot of people. No, we don't like saying it, but it's—
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!
TRUMP: Thank you. Great.
What people, what people. We are going to take care of you. We're going to work together. We won twice here and we won twice everywhere, if you want to really know. We won twice everywhere. Too big to rig. We got to make it too big to rig. Everybody get out. But we're gonna make it too big to rig. But if you're displaced due to the storm, you do not have to return to your home county to vote. You can request a ballot to your temporary housing location and go to trumpvote2024.com/nc for more details.
You know what the amazing thing in the fake news is picking up? That's a lot of fake news tonight. [booing] That's a lot. And up there I would say you have about 9% of decent people. It's like about 9%. It's unbelievable. Boy, it would be nice. You know what? If we had an honest press, a press that wrote the truth, we would be so much further along as a country. [cheers and applause] But that's a big group back there. You know where Kamala is today? They don't want to tell you. She's—No, no, no. You don't know where she is. You know where she is? She's sleeping. She took a day off. She's got no energy at all. Her speeches last for about 15 minutes. Peter knows that by Peter. Her speeches last for about 15, 20 minutes. She's out of there.
So think of this, we have 14 days to the most important election in the history of our country. It's actually only important for us. It's important. For them I don't think it's that important. I really don't think it's that important. But you know what she did? She took a day off. How do you take a day off? 14 days, you don't take days off, right? I've gone 52 days now I got 14 more. We don't take days off. We got to win this thing. If we don't win it, our country's in big trouble. [cheers and applause] Our country's in big trouble. No, I heard it today and she's taking another day off tomorrow, they say. What the hell? Maybe she knows something that we don't know. Do you think she knows some kind of result that we don't know about? Maybe. Maybe she knows something. I doubt it. No, she's bad news. With your help 14 days from now we're going to win North Carolina. [cheers and applause] We're going to defeat Kamala Harris. And we're going to make America great again. We're going to make it so great, right?
This state was once the beating heart of American manufacturing. You know that. You know what happened. But year after year, globalist after globalist, radical left politician after radical left politician. Kamala Harris and her party sold you out, allowed your jobs to be plundered and stolen from you by other countries. After NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization some of the worst things that ever happened to this country, North Carolina lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs like taking candy from a baby. Including 60% of its furniture manufacturing jobs. You know, I used to come here to buy furniture. I'd come here. The artists you had that were artisans that were incredible. I'd like to see a new handle on the chair. And you'd have a guy, ""Oh, yes sir, ding, ding, ding, ding."" I mean the most incredible talent. But stupid politicians took that away from you. Really stupid, horrible politicians. [booing]
They took it away. They took it away. It went to China and lots of other places. And you heard when I bought some furniture, the chairs would break. People would sit in the chairs, they'd break. I end up getting sued all the time. [laughing] I like North Carolina much better, if that's okay. [cheers and applause] Under Kamala, the United States lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs just this year alone. I don't even mention Biden anymore. I don't know what the hell's going on there. Who do you tell? Who's running this place? You know we have—We're close to a nuclear war and we don't know who the hell's running our country.
CROWD MEMBER: Obama.
TRUMP: Is it him? He goes, ""Obama's, running it."" Obama. That's another beauty, Obama. He did great, didn't he? he Did great. If you like a divided country, he was a great—He was fabulous, Obama. He was a real beauty. But under the Trump administration we're going to take back what's ours. We're going to take it back. [cheers and applause] We're going to bring it all back. We're going to end the looting, ransacking, raping, and pillaging of North Carolina in our whole country, because you're one state. But this has happened to many states. Look at what's happened in Michigan with the automobiles. I mean, they were the capital of the world for automobiles. Now they're really just hanging by a thread. And because of me, I just stopped the largest plant anywhere in the world being built in Mexico, owned by China. They were going to make cars.
And they were going to—You know this story. A year ago they announced, ""Largest plant in the world."" They were going to make cars, sell them into the United States and destroy Detroit, Michigan, and all of Michigan. They were going to make more cars in that one plant than all of Michigan makes as a whole. And I said, ""You're not going to do it."" And I said, ""You know what? I'm going to run for president and I'm going to put tariffs on that damn plant. And you're not going to do it."" And—[cheers and applause] I just heard last week they've abandoned the plant, because of Trump. Because they think we're going to get elected. And they say, ""If Trump gets elected, we're going to lose our ass. And we're not going to do it."" So they decided they're not going to build the plant.
But you know what? If she gets in, they'll start the plant like your—like your head will spin. And they'll be selling hundreds of thousands, millions of cars into our country with that big monstrous plant. There are a number of plants. They're all stopped. Every one of them. Because they think I'm going to come in impose 100, maybe 200 or do whatever's necessary. They're not going to have one car come into our country and destroy Michigan and South Carolina and Tennessee—[cheers and applause] and a little bit of North Carolina. But you know, South Carolina has been very big with that. But we're not going to let them destroy our country, our states that do the auto things. You do a little bit of it and sometimes a lot depending on your mood.
You have a lot of things in the state. You cover a lot of territory. Peter, they cover a lot of territory in this state. But the one that I liked best, I loved, and I really mean it, I loved what you did for furniture. Isn't that terrible? I had such a heart for furniture here. It's hard to come back. It's hard to come back. But we're going to bring it back. We're going to bring all of it back. More than you ever had before. [cheers and applause] We're going to bring it all back. We're going to bring it all back. And if she—if she comes—I'll tell you what, if she becomes president of this country, this country is finished. [booing] This country is finished. And I don't like to be that way. And I wasn't that way even with Crooked Hillary. I wasn't talking that way. This woman is a radical left lunatic who has no right even running. She doesn't deserve to be able to run. She came in last in the primary. Now she's running, because they want to be politically correct. I'm not going to let this happen.
Starting in January, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market in the planet. But if we keep going like this, we're not going to have the best market anymore. We're going to be like Venezuela on steroids, okay. That's what we're going to be. And I used to say that. And if I don't get elected, that's what's going to happen. You're going to end up in a 1929 style depression. If you look at what her policies are, she has no idea about business, she has no idea—Frankly, she has no idea about anything. She destroyed San Francisco, which was really the best city, I think maybe the best city in the country. She destroyed it. She helped destroy California along with Gavin Newscum [sic], who was one of the worst governors in the history of our country. But only if they make their products here, they're going to get these benefits. Only if they make their products here in America. And they hire American workers to do the job. [cheers and applause] It's very simple. And if these companies don't make their products here, then they will pay a quite stiff tariff. Nice tariff. We're taking a lot. You know how much China paid us during my time? Hundreds of billions of dollars. No other president got them to pay not 10 cents. Go through all these great presidents. Oh, they were so great. Not 10 cents. China didn't pay 10 cents. And they were ripping us left and right. That's why I got into politics, if you want to call it that. I don't feel I'm a politician, but what the hell? Call me whatever you want. But it really was trade. And you know what? It morphed from trade. And now I say most important thing to me, trade. Always trade with me. We're going to bring jobs back like nobody's ever seen. But the border, it's so horrible what they're doing to us on the border. To me, you know, if you look at the polls, it's the economy and it's inflation, and then it's the border. I think the border is the biggest.
CROWD: BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL!
TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you.
So I think the border has become—To me, it's the worst thing I've ever seen where we're allowing criminals to come in. Hundreds of thousands of criminals to pour into our country. They come from jails, they come from places unknown, from countries we've never even heard of. 181 countries were represented as of last night. Think of it, 180. To me, number one is our border. We don't want murderers. We don't want people from mental institutions coming in. We don't want people coming in who are terrorists. And I think it's number one. And then number two would be economy. And number three is inflation. Or you could put them together, do it any way you want. But I think that the border is the biggest threat to this country, other than of course some horrible, horrible radical left lunatic politicians that we have. That's a pretty big threat to our country also.
But I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. [cheers and applause] I will protect our families. And I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. And we'll have it back there very soon. We're going to have it back there very soon. With four more years of Kamala Harris, North Carolina will be an economic wasteland. That's what's going to happen. The rest of your companies are going to move out. Everybody knows that. The smart people know she's the only one that doesn't know it. Low IQ. She's a low IQ individual. And we've had that for four years. We don't need another four. No country could take that. Can you imagine what President Xi—you know, I got to know him very well. He's a fierce individual. The press, the fake news hates when I say that he's a brilliant man. He runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. If I say he's a brilliant man, they say, ""He called him a—"" Okay, he's not a smart man at all. These people are crazy back there, I'm telling you. Am I allowed to say he's smart? Is he smart? He's a smart man. He's a fierce man. I got along with him very well. Putin. These are people that are tough people. Kim Jong-Un, North Korea. Nuclear weapons all over the place. I said, ""You ever do anything else? Go to a game? Do something?"" He loves producing nuclear weapons. That's what he likes producing. And he's got a lot of them. And he has no respect for our leadership now.
And he doesn't respect—He didn't respect Obama. He thought Obama was a real jerk. A real jerk. And I think he's a real jerk, because I've watched him campaign over the last couple of days—Over the last couple of days, I watched him campaign. What a divider he is, right? What a divider he is. He divide [sic] this country. He couldn't care less, him and his little group of people. He was terrible. But I've watched what he's done. He's trying to campaign, because she's incapable of campaigning. So they send him in to try. He's not going to do it. You know who he helped? He helped Hillary Clinton. How did that work out? He came out for Hillary. [booing] So they sent out the same thing. But the fake news, they don't talk about that. They said, ""Oh, they're bringing out Barack Hussein Obama."" Oh, Barack—remember Rush? Barack Hussein Obama. Rush Limbaugh. We miss him, don't we? Don't we miss him, Peter. They're bringing out Obama. I say, ""Oh, they did that with Hillary. Clinton. Good, I'm glad they're bringing him out."" The reason they're bringing him out, he doesn't even want to do it.
I think he's exhausted. I watched him talking. I think the guy's exhausted. And I never say a guy's looking old, but he's looking a little bit older, isn't he? [laughing] There's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong. But he's exhausted. He's exhausted. But the reason they bring him out, and other people, they're bringing out all these other people. Nobody goes to their rallies. Nobody goes there. So you know what they do? They bring in so-called stars. Stars that I've never even heard of. These are not stars to me. These are not stars to me. But they bring out some people. And what happens is the star comes in, they get a little bit of a crowd. They don't get crowds like this. And they have guitars, I don't, okay. I got nothing up here. And they bring him out and they get an audience. They perform for a couple of minutes. And then they leave. And then the candidate gets up. There's nobody in the room. They got to do it the other way around. Let her speak first.
But they bring him out because they need help, because she cannot talk for more than 15 minutes. And when the teleprompter goes out. Remember ""32, 32, 32 days."" [cheers and applause] 32—I said, ""What the hell is going on with her?"" I was watching. You always want to watch your opponent, right? I was watching her and she started doing that 32. She was just about gone. And then that sucker snapped back on. They go out—It's a dangerous business. If you're a teleprompter reader it could be dangerous, because no matter how good these guys—I have a great guy, but about 5% of the time you lose a teleprompter.
Sometimes it breaks down and snaps. We call it a snap back. It's gone. And now you're on your way and then you go ping and it's back. But no matter how good they are, you lose it 5% of the time. And I thought she lost it. And I just wanted to see a little bit longer. I just wanted to see, because she was over. But if you're—you'd like to go into politics, you got to be able to make a speech without reading a teleprompter. Because if you need a teleprompter like her, you're in trouble. [cheers and applause]
We got two of them, Biden, and her. How about Biden? She'd make his, ""Hello."" And then he could never find—I don't want to hit him too hard anymore though, because you know? I really want to keep it this way where he likes me better than her, because I think it's—[laughing]No, but think of it. They stole the presidency of the United States. They took it. I don't want to use the word coup. Nobody knows what the hell that means. It was a coup, but nobody knows. Here's simpler, they stole the presidency. They walked in, they said, ""You're getting out."" I mean, he didn't have to do that. And then they say, ""He was so brave in getting out. He was so brave. It was so wonderful that he got out. He's a great American hero."" They threw him out. They took him out.
Crazy Nancy Pelosi, she's crazy as—She did a nut job, by the way. And Schumer, I was with Schumer the other night at the big Catholic dinner. How did I do with that dinner? [cheers and applause] The Al Smith dinner, big dinner. 77 years, almost without fail every candidate goes to that out of respect to Catholics. And she said she's not going. It never happens. It hadn't happened in decades. And the last person—We know who that was. The last person lost—let's say he lost everything but one state. You know what state it was? Minnesota, the home of the worst, the stupidest man I've ever seen run for office. Is there something wrong with that guy? He's always bouncing. He's going with his heart. [gestures hitting his chest, leaning over] Yeah, I never got that. But there's something wrong with that guy, I'm telling you.
And you know, that should enter in—And I have somebody the exact opposite. A brilliant guy, J.D. Vance, who's really very solid, very solid. [cheers and applause] Kamala's inflation has already cost the typical family over $30,000 on higher prices. And now she wants to raise the typical family's taxes by nearly $3,000 a year. Take a look at this.
[start of video montage]
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala Harris is going to significantly raise taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are gonna have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: Kamala's plan will raise family's taxes by nearly $2,600 a year. Under Kamala, prices have already soared. Now, she'd make it worse with even higher taxes.
HARRIS: Taxes are gonna have to go up.
UNNAMED ANNOUNCER: President Trump will cut taxes again. No taxes on tips, overtime, or social security.
[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: I'm Donald J. Trump and I approved this message.
[end of video]
TRUMP: Thank you. Remember when I said no taxes on tips? And then like a month later, she goes, ""We will have no taxes on tips."" And the place was booing her. They said, ""A little bit late."" Anyway, and you never heard it. I haven't even heard her say it again after that, because that just shows you the kind of dedication they have to their statements. No, she's the taxing queen. And she's also demanding a shocking 33% tax hike in all domestic production along with the largest capital gains tax hike in history. This is going to be the largest tax anybody's ever had to pay. And every business is going to leave our country and go to another country. They don't have to stay here. They have a lot of opportunity. It used to be you'd go to a different state, now they go to a different country. They'll go to Asia, they'll go to Europe, they'll go to different countries.
And you've had that. And all you're doing is forcing them out and with them goes the jobs and the money. By contrast, I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses and do just as you saw, no tax on tips. [cheers and applause] No tax on overtime. And no tax on social security benefits. I will make—Here's something that I think is going to be great. Think of this. And I just made a decision to do it a little bit differently, because I'm only going to do it if they build that particular product, namely an automobile, in the United States. Listen to this. I will make interest on car loans fully tax deductible, because affording a car is essential to restoring the American dream. [cheers and applause]
So I had calls from the biggest people in Wall Street, ""Where did you come up with these ideas? The no tax on Tips. Who gave that to you?"" Actually, it was a waitress at Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. I didn't pay a consultant $5 million to come up with the idea. Waitress said, ""It's terrible the way they're treating us with tips."" And a lot of them, I mean a lot of people don't report those tips anyway, really? I guess it's a weird kind of a thing. ""How do you tax it?"" Somebody puts $5 in their pocket. Let's see. But she gave me the idea. But they said, ""How did you come up with this thing on deductibility of interest on automobiles?""
I said it was just an idea I had, but I had a better idea because here's what I'm doing. I want it to benefit—I don't want it to benefit other countries. I want it to benefit us, so its deductibility of interest is great, but only if the car is manufactured in the United States. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: Is that a great idea? [cheers and applause] Why the hell would we give them taxes if they manufacture the car in China, or Japan, or lots of other places that stole our business over the years? Mexico is a very big threat. I'm telling you, it's a big threat. So, we're doing that now and I think that's going to be great for Detroit. And we're leading in Michigan, by the way, by good margin because of the brilliant mandate that next week you're going to be forced to drive all electric. Everybody's going to have an electric car. [booing]
They don't go far. They cost too much. And by the way, they're great. You know what? They're great. And Elon makes the best of them, as far as I'm concerned. [cheers and applause] And he'll be the first to admit it's a certain market and it's a certain market for certain things, but you have to have gasoline-powered—Here we have more gasoline, we have more oil and gas, we have more liquid gold than anybody in the world, and we're trying to go all electric. So, we want that. We want hybrids. We don't want hydrogen cars. We don't want hydrogen. Would anybody like a hydrogen car? You know what a hydrogen car [sic]? It's a great car. It's a wonderful car, except if it happens to explode, then you are unrecognizable.
They said they have it down, they don't think more than 10 or 20 will explode a year, but if it does, you're gonzo. So, we told them, ""Let's not spend a lot of money on that."" That's one of those things, no matter how good it is, you don't want it. But other than that, they said it works quite well. On day one of the Trump administration, I will terminate Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate and we will end the Green New Scam once and for all. [cheers and applause] The Green New Scam, you know whose idea that was, right? AOC, young girl. Very nice person. [booing] She never even studied the environment in college. Average student at best. She was an average student.
She walked in one day, she said, ""We're going to all be dead in 12 years because the oceans are rising."" Well, it's been more than 12 years. What's going on? No, we have a much bigger threat. We have a threat called nuclear weapons and having stupid people running our country. And if you talk about global warming, that's the real global warming, not this nonsense of the ocean's going to rise over the next 400 years by one-eighth of an inch, and we're going to be wiped out. No, we have a threat right now. We better get smart because we're very close to World War III. If you take a look at what's going on, we're very close. So, we have a couple of different areas, but we'll have more than that.
And you can look at the side, look at the teams. They're already being divided up. You see what's going on with Iran, and Russia, and China, and now other countries are adding into that group, North Korea. No, no, no. We have very stupid people letting this happen. That should have never happened. Now they want to attack our dollar. They want to take our dollar away from us. They want to take our dollar and not have that be the standard any longer. And that would be like losing a world war, then we would be indeed third world status. And if I'm elected, they're not doing that. I guarantee you that. No chance. [cheers and applause]
Just like Russia would've never attacked Ukraine. Zero. By the way, even a Democrat congressman was on television, and many Democrats are saying that. And by the way, for four years, they didn't. So, it's not like, oh, gee, they won't. For four years, they didn't. I think what happened is when Putin saw how weak we were, how pathetic we were with the stupid Milley and these generals that aren't even generals as far as I was concerned. What a stupid group of people they were. Mattis, Milley. You know the real ones, the ones that I used to defeat ISIS? We defeated ISIS. They were the real generals. [cheers and applause] They were the real generals. They weren't the television generals. They weren't the dumb ones. They were the ones that were warriors.
But we'll quickly become energy independent, and we will frack, frack, frack, and we will drill, baby, drill. We're going to drill. [cheers and applause] And in 12 months from January 20, that's the day we take office, I will cut your energy prices by 50, 5-0% [sic], 50% within one year. And we can do it. [cheers and applause] No other country can say it. Very few countries can say it, but no other country can say that we have more liquid gold. We're going to drill. Your prices are going to come down. Then everything else is going to start coming down, too, because you're paying too much. You know what people tell me mostly? Groceries. A simple word, groceries. The overall effect of bacon, and lettuce, and all of this stuff is the biggest, the worst we've ever had. We've never had anything like it.
How about interest rates? When I was president—Think of this: When I was president, interest was 2.2%. Now it's 10% and you can't get any money, so it's much higher than 10%. And I have really good news, because I keep hearing people say, ""2.50, 2.25 a gallon."" So the other day I'm looking at some things and some statistics. So, we had $1.84 a gallon. That was the real price that you had. [cheers and applause] $1.84 compared to now it's about $4, but it was up to $5, and California was 7 and $8. We were at 1.84, and everybody was happy. It was nice to drive to Washington D.C. But the problem with Washington D.C., too dangerous. We're going to clean that city up, but we're going to make it greater. We're going to make it safe so you can go down and you can see the Washington Monument. [cheers and applause]
You can go see honest Abe and you can see Thomas Jefferson. They wanted to rip that down. Remember, they wanted to rip down the Thomas Jefferson? And I said, ""That's not going to happen."" Remember I passed that law, the old law that was—They came into town, they wanted to rip down our statues. And I said, ""Well, do they have a point?"" A couple of them were a little rough. Then I said, ""Well, now I heard they want to rip down honest Abe Lincoln."" That's—Now you're getting a little bit nasty. And I went out and we were tough. I said, ""Give me that law. I want to sign it immediately."" We took it. It was an old law from early 1900s.
And it basically said that if you so much as look at or touch any monument anywhere in the country, federal monument anywhere in the country, you get immediately 10 years in jail with no early getting out stuff. [cheers and applause] And I signed it with a news conference. Remember I said, ""Anybody that wants to play games with me, you can play games, but it's not going to work out well."" And we had a lot of people in Washington, they were having a lot of fun thinking about which statue they're going to take down. And as soon as I signed it, I watched the backs of those people, I don't want to use the word asses. I watched the backs of those people leaving town. They all left town very nicely. We had no problem.
But just recently, a month ago, they were in Washington and they're spray-painting beautiful limestone lions and doing tremendous damage, fighting with the police. And by the way, nothing happened to those people. You know, when you spray paint over limestone, you'll see it in 100 years from now because limestones are very poor. I was really good at real estate and building. Limestone's very poor, as poor stone. And that stuff goes right into that. You can't get it out unless you want to do it with a chisel and that's not going to work. And you're going to see that in 100 years from now—And it's very, very sad. And nothing happened to those people. Nothing.
I watched it very closely, and they did great destruction and they had fistfights with our cops. They had fistfights. They were rolling on the grass and fighting our police. Nothing happened to them. Under Kamala's economy, millions of Americans are suffering because of inflation. They're losing their jobs. They can't afford housing, groceries or a car, and yet Kamala is importing millions of illegals across our borders and giving them taxpayer benefits at your expense, [booing] while taking the jobs from African-Americans and from Hispanic Americans at levels that we have not seen. You're going to see reports coming out very soon. They're trying to hold it until after the election. Hopefully, it won't matter because we're going to win by so much. [cheers and applause]
But let them give you the reports of what's happening to our African-American population, our Hispanic population. They are taking the jobs of our African-Americans and Hispanic Americans, and it's tremendous numbers. And they're going to release these numbers sometime after the election, and everyone's going to be upset and nothing they could do. You're going to have to wait four more years. And I'm not sure we can wait four more years, because I don't know that we'll have a country in four more years. So they better—you ought to start looking at that to the fake news media. Show them what's happening to the Black population and to the Hispanic population, with these people that are coming into our country illegally.
You are witnessing the economic oppression of Americans to reward and enrich illegal aliens. You know, they come into hotels, and they stay in hotels, in luxury hotels paid for by the government. And they walk past our veterans who are sleeping on the street right in front of that hotel. [booing] But all of that stops two weeks from tonight. It all stops. [cheers and applause] For four straight years, Kamala Harris has imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo, not just South America. This is all over the world.
We're the dumping ground for the whole world to put their criminals into. And she has resettled them into your communities to prey upon innocent Americans. And that's what they're doing. You just take a look at what's going on in Colorado. Take a look at what's going on there. They're taking over. They're in the real estate business like I am. The only difference is I go out and borrow nice money from a bank. They do it with guns. You see what's going on in Aurora? But it's not just Aurora. It's hundreds of communities. They don't want to talk about it, because they don't want to destroy the reputation of the community. And they better start talking about it because they won't have a community.
When I win on November 5th, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. It's going to begin. [cheers and applause]
[stepping away from podium, pointing to crowd member] Are you from yesterday? Is that you? Is that you from yesterday? Yesterday?
CROWD: TRUMP! TRUMP TRUMP!
TRUMP: One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gang that Kamala has imported into our country. She's, ""Let him just come in."" Remember, she's a stupid person. [laughing] Open borders. Open borders. As soon as I saw it, I said, ""Well, wait a minute. I know the world."" I know many of the leaders of the world, other than the ones that were changed. Not that many. I know them. They're smart. They're street wise. Very street wise people. I said, ""Wait a minute, they're going to let all their prisoners out into our country."" When you have open borders, there's no check-in, there's no vetting.
And very importantly, border patrol, they're phenomenal. They endorsed me last week with the strongest endorsement that you've ever seen. [cheers and applause] Unanimous. Unanimous. And in the endorsement, they said, ""She's so bad, there's never been anybody bad."" That by itself should cause her—Thousands of people voted for me, unanimous endorsement of the border patrol, because we had the safest border—bring down my favorite chart. I love this chart. I sleep with this chart. I kiss this chart every night. I love it. I love this chart. I love that. Beautiful. Every night I roll it up and I kiss it, because I wouldn't be here right now without that chart.
I look to my right, ping [sic], and I said, ""What the hell happened?"" But look at that arrow on the bottom. That's when I left office. That's the day I left office right there. That's the lowest we've ever had. This was done by border patrol, by the way. And look what happened after I left. There was an explosion like one of Elon's rocket ships. Look at that. How good is Elon, by the way? Is he good? [cheers and applause] You know, here's a guy, when you talk about—He is so smart. We are inside beautiful place, beautiful arena packed, nice, probably 71 degrees. We finally have air conditioning. Some of these things don't have air conditioning. It's brutal.
Congratulations to the people who own this place, whoever the hell owns it. We appreciate the air con—but it's like 71 degrees. It's beautiful. Elon is right now in Pennsylvania politicking, because he thinks this is the most important election in history. And he says, ""We won't have a country."" How cool is that? [cheers and applause] And he's registering voters. He's an amazing guy. How cool was the rocket ship that landed the other day? [cheers and applause] I never saw it. I don't want to—if you heard it, just turn off your ears for a second. I'm talking to a very important guy and I have the no sound on the teller muted, and I'm looking at the teller and talking to this guy.
Very important, but quite boring to be honest with you. I hope he doesn't watch me say this ,because he'll be able to figure out who it is. But anyway, I said, ""Wait a minute, would you hold on please, just for a second?"" Because I'm looking at the screen. I'm seeing this 20-story, huge tube pouring down and you know, fire's pouring out of it. And it used to be white, but the heat is thousands of degrees coming down. They say thousands and thousands, so it's been beat up in that trip down. And I see this massive tube is coming down, and the fire's burning, and brights [inaudible] exploding all over the place. I said, ""Oh, my, this is terrible. It's going to crash. What the hell is it?"" I wasn't even sure. Maybe it was a movie.
But I'm looking, it's the news. And I see it and then all of a sudden it's going to hit the gantry, and a flame comes out of the left, and pushes it over like it was nothing. I say, ""What the hell?"" And then bwah [sic]—And then these two giant arms come. They envelop it like a beautiful—I won't say it. I get myself into too much trouble. [cheers and applause] When I say that stuff, it's so great. I'd like to, but I'm not going to because I'm going to be politically correct, if you don't mind. You know what Elon says? ""Like two giant chopsticks."" See, wouldn't I be better off if I said that? [laughing] Wouldn't that, Mr. Wall? This guy is the greatest guy. Stand up. I love this guy. [cheers and applause] Comes to so many of these.
And he's a very successful guy, but he likes these rallies. He's had a lot of them. And we have the ladies from North Carolina here too. Would you stand up? [cheers and applause] I call them the beautiful ladies from North Carolina. And you're not allowed to call ladies beautiful anymore. It's the end of your political career. If you say, ""Aren't they beautiful?"" That's the end of your political career, but who cares? You are beautiful. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [cheers and applause] What number is this? 230 or 240 or something? And they're happily married, because I've met their husbands. Their husbands are really nice. I don't know how the hell they put up with this stuff, but at least here we're in North Carolina. How long a trip was this? Pretty short, right?
CROWD MEMBER: Two and a half hours.
TRUMP: Well, that's a long time, two and a half. That's like short compared to Texas, California. Thank you very much. It's a great honor. It's always nice to them. They're always so brightly dressed. They got plenty of cash. They're so brightly and beautifully dressed all the time. And quaffed, they're beautifully quaffed. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. And we have our front road Jacks. We have our front row Jacks and Joes. Thank you very much. What happened? You're not in the front row. These must be very powerful people in the front. Look at these people. Who are these people? They kept the wall back there. Wow, we got to figure this out. That young man must be a very powerful guy, but we appreciate it.
We've had a lot of rallies and we're going to have our biggest of all at Madison Square Garden. [cheers and applause] We're going to make a play for New York. Hasn't been won in many, many decades. But with what's going on in New York between the illegal migrants and the crime they're causing, and hurting people so badly, and all of the problems in New York, we're going to give it a hell of a shot. So, we took Madison Square Garden. We filled it up. Think of this, sold out in three hours. Done. Can you imagine? [cheers and applause] If a normal politician—And I don't say this in any way, I just say if a politician—Take our best politician. After me, take our best politician. If you had 250, 300 people, you'd have 300 people in a ballroom or something.
Ronald Reagan would have 350 people, 400 people. We sell out these things 25,000 people at Madison Square Garden, because we use the floor, the basketball. So, we have the whole thing. Holds 18 or 19,000. We have the floor and it's sold out in three hours. So, that's a great honor. But we're going to do—do a big one in the Atlanta arena. We're trying to sign the Philadelphia arena. We had tremendous success in Long Island, where the ice hockey team plays, the Islanders. And we could have sold that thing out four times. It was incredible. So, we're doing them. And it's sad because we're sort of wrapping it up, you know that, right?
We've been doing this now for a long time. We had two unbelievable elections. We had two. No, no, well. But we are. I didn't even think of it. I was being interviewed by a very good person today, actually. And that person said, ""When you did Madison Square Garden, it's in a week."" They said, ""Is that sort of wrapping it all up, right?"" And I said, ""I never thought of it that way, but I guess you could."" We have a few days left after that, but we sort of are. When you think we've been doing it from 2015, and now we're where we are. So, we're talking about nine years, almost 10 years by the time we do it.
And there's something—and think of what we've done. This is the greatest movement in political history. [cheers and applause] I mean, there's never been anything like that. The greatest movement in political history. Oh, look, there's Uncle Sam back there. Look at that guy. He shook my hand. This guy's got the hardest handshake. My hand is still recovering from his handshake. Uncle Sam, how are you? And I have no idea who he is, I promise you. Somebody says, ""Oh, do you pay these people?"" I don't pay him. I don't pay the Wall, I don't pay Uncle Sam, but they're incredible patriots. And you know what? They're very smart people. They're incredible people. But this is like a football game to some. They come in, these guys, they're accountants. They head accounting firms, law firms, and they got the name of some football player in the back. I don't know if I could do that.
Well, maybe Lawrence Taylor, he's my friend. I'll come in with a Lawrence Taylor. [cheers and applause] These are all guys. We have a lot of endorsements from athletes, that I can tell you. But thank you, Uncle Sam. But it's sort of interesting. I never thought of it. We're wrapping it up. We're wrapping up something that has been incredible. There's never been anything like this, the rallies, the size of them, the enthusiasm. And we have more enthusiasm now than we did for 2016 or 2020. But we really started—we really started in 2015, about a year before, a little less than a year before. We started in 2015. And it's been really amazing. It's been great to be with you, and now we want to close it out with a beautiful bang. And we want to straighten out the country.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible] We pray for you.
TRUMP: Thank you, darling. I pray for you, too. Thank you. Thank you. [cheers and applause] But it's been like a movement of love. And—and you know, it's like—When we first started, there used to be some fights and there were problems where you have fight. Not much, but we had some. And I don't want to jinx it by saying, but it's been, it's been like love. It's been amazing. It is. And you know what? The people back there, when I say things, if I'm a little bit off, they'll go headlines, headlines. And I don't mean to be a little bit off, but this is the single-greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been anything like that. [cheers and applause]
And, and if it wasn't, if it were just slightly behind some other movement that nobody could even come close to talking about, they would have headlines. I have to be very careful when I say things. So, he said that. And he said, ""Is this wrapping it up?"" And I never thought of it. I didn't think of it that way. We're in the heart of battle and we have to win our country. And then we're going to have four great years. And that's a different kind of a battle. But for what we're doing for the campaigning, this would be pretty much—we're 14 days from wrapping it up. And we're going to have different kinds of get-togethers. And hopefully, it's going to be get-togethers of success. We're going to base it on success. We're going to have great success with this country. [cheers and applause]
We're going to bring back our businesses. We're going to stop crime in the streets. We're going to close up our borders. We're going to let people come in to our country, but we need people to take all these jobs that will—We're going to be creating a lot of jobs just by the very smart use of tariffs, taxes, and incentives, just like I told you. Just come up with one. And literally, I did it with a friend of mine who's a great businessperson. I said, ""What do you think of the idea, like the idea of the deduction for a car, interest deduction for a car?"" But then I said, ""But to get it, you have to build a car in the United States."" Who would think of that?
It sounds simple, like the paperclip. It's very simple. Somebody came up 129 years ago or something, they came up with a paperclip. And other people looked at it and they said, ""How the hell—Why didn't I think of this idea?"" And now you'll have everybody come out and say, ""We're going to deduct interest."" But you know what? It doesn't have the same ring. No, that's a big deal. We're going to make so many cars in Detroit with that. That's going to be so big. But I said, ""Wait a minute, if I do this, what are we going to do? Make more cars in China?"" You know, China, I put a tariff on Chinese. Cut 27.5%. And because of that, they're not flooding our country.
They're destroying Europe. They're just flooding Europe with cars. But we've kept our car companies, but it's a fraction of what it used to be. We had the glory days. We were making everybody's cars. The Cadillac was the most beautiful—To my father having a Cadillac, he'd get a Cadillac every two years. That was his definition of luxury. ""I just want a Cadillac every two years"" And today, you know, they don't talk so much about that.
CROWD MEMBER: What about our military? [inaudible]
TRUMP: We're going to take care of our military better. We're going to take care of our military better than anybody. [cheers and applause] You know, with our military, we took care of our veterans better than anybody has ever taken care. We took care of our veterans. We got a 92% approval rating, and now it's back down to 44 or 43. We did choice. We had choice. So, if a person had to wait of a—one of our great, because I call them heroes, one of our great heroes had to wait for a doctor. If they had to wait more than one day, they go out and they get a doctor, we pay the bill. And in the end, not only was it good for them, it was also even efficient because some of these people were dying.
They'd wait for four, five, six, seven months. And we have great doctors in the VA, but the problem was the administration. And our guys did a fantastic job. We did another thing in the VA. We got rid of all the sadists and the sickos or wackos. You couldn't farm, because the civil service laws. And I got this all passed. We got this all passed in Congress. It was an amazing thing, to get it passed in Congress. They've been trying for 58 years for one and for 54 years for the other. And it worked out great. And now I understand that as of like yesterday, they're trying to get rid of, they call it choice, where you have a choice of going outside, getting a doctor.
And I understand that they're trying to end that program. They don't like that program. That this group of people that have no idea what they're doing, don't like it, so they'll go back to waiting. But we'll get it back. We'll get it back so fast your head will spin. They want to end it. They don't like it for some reason. I don't know why, but they don't like it. People were getting instant care, and it wasn't very expensive. When you take into the fact that, and just take a look at this, you have a guy, he gets sicker, sicker, sicker, sicker, then he becomes terminally ill, and they have to take care. In the end, I think it's probably cost-effective, but I don't even care about the cost in that case. We take care of our people.
Who would want to wait months to get, in some cases, a simple pill or a simple shot? And it was a terrible thing. But we had a 92% approval rating, the highest ever. The people that I had there did a fantastic job. We're going to bring it all back. We're going to bring it back fast. [cheers and applause] And one other thing, I mean, isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't have to read these stupid teleprompters? Isn't it? [cheers and applause] Sort of interesting. I haven't looked at them in the last 15 minutes. It's interesting. But I just do what we have to do. But we did another program, Right to Try. It's the greatest thing. For 51 years, they've been trying to get it, because we have the best doctors, the best lab technicians, the best labs, the best everything. And nobody could get it done, where we'd have something that really looked good for a certain disease or problem.
It really looked good, but they couldn't do anything because the FDA wouldn't be able to approve it for years. I got that number way down, by the way, but they wouldn't be able to approve it for years, and what would happen was terrible. They would go to Asia. They'd go to Europe. They'd go all over if they had money. Most of them didn't have money. They'd go home and they'd die. They'd die. So I said, ""We got to do something about this."" And they've been trying for 50 years. They couldn't get it done because the doctors didn't want it because of the liability. The insurance companies certainly didn't want it. The labs didn't want it. Nobody wanted it, but nobody—everybody, they knew it was good, but they didn't want it.
I got everybody into a room, and I said, ""Listen, we're going to sign an agreement. There's not going to be any liability to anybody. If somebody's terminally ill, they're going to sign a document that they're not going to sue the insurance company, their family. They're not going to sue anybody. They're not going to sue the doctor, the lab. They're not going to sue anybody. Everything's going to be fine, and we're going to try it and see how it works.""
It's been so successful. We have saved thousands and thousands of lives with this new—with this new medicine. [cheers and applause] It's a new age. I call it new age medicine, but we've saved thousands of people. People don't write about it. It's called right to try. A lot of people don't—I hope nobody needs it, to be honest with you, but it's been so—I've never read anything about it. They don't want to write about it, and if they don't, that's okay. The fact is that thousands of people have been saved, their lives have been saved, and many were terminal, and now they're actually okay. They're not even terminal. It's not like they have to even go. It literally cured—
And even the doctors now and the medical companies, the labs, they're really happy they did it because when you can cure somebody when they're that sick, it really shows it worked. It sort of worked out the opposite. It really shows that it worked. So right to try. It's been a great thing and we're honored to have done it.
One of the deadliest and most vicious migrant gangs that Kamala has imported into our country, the savage Venezuelan prison gang they form in the Venezuelan prisons. It's called Tren de Aragua that's taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent terrorist spree in our country. Let's take a look. Take a look at this.

[end of video]
TRUMP: That's what's happening. These are the people we're letting in. And you remember where she was saying that they don't commit crimes like our people. Really? These are worse than anybody. We—They make our criminals look like they're nice people. These are rough, horrible people. They could not be allowed to stay in our country.
The United States is now an occupied country in effect, but on November 5th, 2024, we will have a thing called Liberation Day. We're going to have liberation Day. [cheers and applause] In the last year alone, over 70,000 illegal aliens from China have crossed our border. You know about that. Many of them military-aged men, 70,000 in a year. 70,000, that's getting to be army territory, and that's the equivalent of over 14 brigades or five army divisions of Chinese illegals that have penetrated our country. Again, these are military aged, mostly men, almost all men. Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that nice? Under Border Czar Harris—she has no idea. The woman doesn't have a clue. Again, she's sleeping now while I'm working my ass off. [cheers and applause]
Under Border Czar Harris, there have been at least two million gotaways. That's gotaways. They come through and nobody knows where the hell they're from. And that's by the way, nobody has any idea. If they think it's two million is probably five times that amount. Two million gotaways from all over the world who charged the border and disappeared into the United States. They could be living right next to you. North Carolina, lovely house, little cabin right next to you. More than the entire active-duty force of the United States military. This is the kind of numbers we're talking about. And they're rough. They're rough people.
Who would've allowed this to happen? The only good thing coming from this crime against our country is if you happen to be the person that's running against the idiots that allowed it to take place, that's me. I'm running against them. It's good to run against it, but I'd rather not be running against it, and I'd rather not have it happen. Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. [cheers and applause] We have no idea. We have no choice. It's not sustainable.
I will rescue every town across America that's been invaded and conquered. They're conquering. They're conquering towns. And these fools, these fools, these stupid people back there, the media, they're going to say, ""Oh, he used the word, conquer."" You know the governor of Colorado, he's a radical left Democrat, he's petrified of—He doesn't know what to do. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail or kick them the hell out of our country as fast as we can. [cheers and applause]
And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that, 1798. You know why? That's when we had real politicians, real people, real people that knew what to do, not these weak woke fools. So I have to go back to 1798. Can you believe it? But it's a strong one. Think of it. Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and they used it to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil to make our people safe. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. [cheers and applause] And I am hereby calling for the death penalty. And we have to do this. I'm calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or an enforcement law enforcement officer. [cheers and applause]
You kill an American citizen or a law enforcement officer, you get the death penalty and we'll get that approved too, because Congress is going to approve it. They're feeling the way you are. I will end catch and release. Thank you.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
TRUMP: I have to ask this man in the black. Are you the man that I met yesterday or not?
CROWD MEMBER: No, you didn't meet me but I love you, man!
TRUMP: That's a pretty—You're just as good. I met some great people yesterday. I saw the devastation. It was incredible. He just said, ""No, you didn't meet me, but I love you, man."" Thank you. That's cool. You're very cool. You are very cool. Thank you.
CROWD MEMBER: [inaudible].
TRUMP: I will end—Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I will end all migrant flights. They fly in by plane. They come in. We only learned that less than a year ago. They said, ""We're going to start closing up the border a little bit."" Well, all they have to do—She could walk into the White House, say, ""Wake Biden up. I want him to sign something."" And all he has to do is say, ""Close the border."" He doesn't need a bill. The bill was so horrible. He says, ""Donald Trump called the Senate and said, don't pass it."" It's wonderful. I wish I could do that. Okay, not that easy. But the truth is, I had nothing to do with it, and I would be proud to do it because it was such a bad bill. But he doesn't need a bill. I didn't have a bill. I closed the board. I had the safest border. You see it.
I had the safest border in the history of our country. We now have the worst border in the history of the world. Maybe in the history of the world. And again, it's the number one thing to campaign on. I mean, I think the inflation is horrible, the economy, everything. We have a lot of bad things. The number one, you see those killers, those guys that have military style weapons, I mean, people are saying, ""Where the hell do people coming out of Venezuela, young thugs that are tough as hell, by the way, where do they get this equipment?"" But I think it's the number one thing that we're going to have it fixed. You know, I fixed it in 2016. I fixed it. I did it so good. I couldn't talk about it for the next election. My people said, ""Sir, they don't want to hear about the border.""
I said, ""What do you mean you don't want to hear? I did such a great job. I fixed it. We had the best border."" But that border was 5% of what it is now. That border was bad. It was really bad, but it wasn't very tough for me to fix. That border was nothing compared to the mess you have now. We don't have a border. And I built hundreds of miles of wall. I built much more than I said I was going to build. Then we added 200 and they didn't want to put up the slats. And you know what they did? Many of them were sold for 5 cents on the dollar. It's just so sold. [booing] I will outlaw sanctuary cities immediately, and I will ban all welfare and federal benefits for illegals. [cheers and applause]
We are running against the most radical, most incompetent, most unfit vice president running for president. Can you believe it? In the history of our country. She's totally unfit for office. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. And something is clearly wrong with her. Something is wrong with her. Something's wrong with her, and something's wrong with his vice president. He is off. She can't put two sentences together. How about 60 Minutes was that the greatest? You know, we're probably going to sue them just for the hell of it. Listen, listen. 60 Minutes, she interviews. She was so bad. She gave an answer. This never happened to me. Why does it happen? She gave an answer that was so bad that they changed it. They took it out, threw it out. They didn't edit a little bit. Take a word out. No, no, no. They took the entire—It was a long stupid—She didn't know where the hell she was going. Does she drink? Is she on drugs? I don't know. I have no idea. She writes 60 Minutes, you know big 60 Minutes, CBS. You know they have to be licensed by the federal government. They should take their license away. What they did? CBS—And they're all bad. How about David Muir? How bad is he? [booing] How bad is he? I said, ""Crime is going up."" And he said, ""No, it's not. It's going down."" I said, ""It's going up."" He said, ""Crime is going down."" Next question. The next day they released the numbers crime's up 45% in our country. I don't watch him anymore. Pretty boy. Little pretty boy, he is. [laughing]
Think it. She gives this horrible answer. They take every word of it and they throw it away and they insert another answer. That's called election interference. And it's called fraud. And they should have their li—[sic] And you know, all the other guys back there are sticking up for them. You know why? Because they do the same thing, probably. They don't do it for me. You know what they do with me? They make my answer worse. They write—No, they take out, like if I give—I do the weave, you know the weave? I'll tell the story and I'll go from here being—It's actually genius, I have to say, fair and smart. People say it's total genius, but they say, ""Oh, he wandered."" I didn't wander. Wander is when you don't get back to the same point. Now, I give the weave. They don't do anything for me.
What they do with me is I give a beautiful paragraph and they'll take some of the primary sentences out. And that's terrible to do, but that you can sort of get away with. You know, I can even understand it. They want to make it a little shorter. They want a little more time. They don't pay anything for their license. They have a license that's worth billions of dollars. They don't pay anything. Neither does NBC fake news. And ABC fake news is really one of the worst. I will tell you, ABC. But this is CBS. They don't pay for—They use our airwaves. They don't pay anything. And then you hear that 60 Minutes, which is a news show. It's under their news division. So they're not allowed—This isn't an entertainment show. But they took the sentence—not the sentence. They took a whole paragraph, big paragraph, just word after word when that was like the 32 that I listened to.
You know—you know, 32 with a teleprompter where she basically choked and froze like a dog. But that was like the 32. They took it out and they inserted a new answer that was more rational, wasn't great, but it was at least you don't say, ""What's wrong with this person?"" Where did you ever hear them doing that? That's called election—This is an election. We're in the middle of an election. She gave a horrible answer on a new show that pays nothing for the airwaves that are worth billions of dollars. And the other networks stick up because they don't want it to happen to them either. They don't want to see a bidding contest for who's going to do the news, but there has to be some kind of justice in this country. You can't take her answer out, insert a new answer and say, ""This is called major election interference fraud."" [cheers and applause]
So we'll see what happens. I actually think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history. I really believe that. I think it's the biggest scandal. Nobody's seen anything like it. And people are furious about it, and they all come out with some answer. Well, we did this because of that. They took the answer out. They put a new answer in. There's nothing. There's no justification. So we're probably going to take him to court. Should I take him to court? [cheers and applause] Okay, so we've asked them. We sent them a letter yesterday. We've asked for the entire transcript and we want to see, did they do it in other places too? And we'll see what happens but good. So I have your permission, right? [cheers and applause]
Who would think of these things? I mean, who would think? And it was a mistake. They made a mistake. That's how everybody found that they made a mistake. They put out the original answer. Somehow somebody saw the original answer, said that's not the answer she gave. And when they went back, they feel it was—They found out it was a fraud. It was a fraud on the American public, and they should pay a big price for it.
And if they do pay a big price, it won't happen anymore. She's an international joke and she's going to end up getting us into World War III and Kamala is in free fall. You know, she's in free fall with Arab and Muslim voters. Now in Michigan, did you notice that my poll numbers are very good with the Arab voters? Did you see that? My poll numbers are very good. I appreciate it. You know why? You know why? Because I want peace in the Middle East. I want peace. I did the Abraham Accords. I want peace in the Middle East. [cheers and applause]
So it's very simple. I want to see peace in the Middle East. But my poll numbers in Michigan are very good with the—I was supposed to be zero. She was supposed to be 100. Now I'm beating her because they see how bad she is. But they don't like or respect her. She's sent their overseas—I mean, you take a look. She's sent their jobs overseas. She's brought in crime to the cities. She's taken in all of this tremendous fire. She's okay with it. That took place in the Middle East. But you ask yourself, why would Muslims support lying Kamala Harris when she embraces Muslim hating and very dumb person Liz Cheney? A dumb person who by the way, lost for Congress in the biggest margin in the history of politics. She lost by almost 40 points. [cheers and applause]
The reason she has that honor is that most people, most people wouldn't have stayed in. A congressperson that's in that position normally retires before the election, which would've been a good idea for her to do. But Liz Cheney is a total loser. But her father brought years of war and death to the Middle East. He killed many, many Arabs and Muslims. And now lying Kamala has embraced Liz Cheney. She embraced her. And why would a Muslim or why would an Arab want to vote for somebody that has Liz Cheney as her hero? Liz Cheney is a failed—totally failed politician. Again, she set the worst record. I think it's a terrible mistake that she's made. I think it's a great insult to Muslims all over the world. And I think that she's going to do very bad in Michigan. I really do. I think she's going to do very badly. To do that was a bad thing. And I was very surprised to see it.
But in one way, I was happy because you have to understand, I'm competing against her. I'm competing against this stupid person. I think we are winning by a lot. I have a feeling we're winning by a lot. [cheers and applause]
But this person cannot be president. By the way, is there any place better to be than a Trump rally? [cheers and applause] And don't get used to this because it's only going to go on for another two weeks. It's really something. It's only going to go on to—In four years, you'll be having rallies of 100 people, 200 people. Mr. Wall will be doing other things. Front Row Joes are going to be doing—how these guys are boring as hell. We got two more weeks together with our big—We had 101,000 people in Butler. Think of that. We had 107,000 people in New Jersey. We're making a move for New Jersey too. [cheers and applause]
And two weeks ago in California, we had 109,000 people. So don't get too used to this. What are you going to do Mr. Wall when you come to a rally and there's like 150 people, what are you going to do?
""MR. WALL"": [inaudible] In four years, we'll be back for JD Vance. [cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Oh. You like—Right? That's very good. That's good. Good man. I'll tell you that. When the people of North Carolina were stranded and drowning in Hurricane Helene, Kamala Harris was at a glitzy fundraiser in the city that she destroyed, San Francisco. [booing] She spent the last four years taking your money to provide shelter and benefits to illegal aliens. But when North Carolina needed help, Kamala Harris was nowhere to be found. [booing]
You know, they spent your money. They're going to probably have to call it an emergency meeting, a special session of Congress, because the illegal migrants, many of them killers, many of them drug dealers, many of them released from prison, have taken the money that they were supposed to spend in North Carolina and Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee and Florida and South Carolina.
The money was supposed to be spent in those states. And they don't have the money now. They don't have the money because they've spent hundreds—Think of it, hundreds of millions of dollars they've spent flying migrants into states all over the country and letting them go through your porous wall. Kamala Harris does not have the compassion, the smarts, or the strength to be president of the United States. She can't do the job. She's not mentally or physically able to do the job. And on top of all of it, she says she would not do anything differently. She would not do anything differently, she said. Then crooked Joe Biden, which is disqualifying. When you see this tape, you're going to say she's disqualified. He's the worst president. 85% wrong direction. What would you do differently? ""Well, I can't think of anything now."" Let's take a look.
[start of video montage]
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?
KAMALA HARRIS: There has not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: We stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.
NARRATOR: The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan, stunned Americans at the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder and been caught at the board, and then released into the United States.
NARRATOR: An Afghan National is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.
NARRATOR: Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia. Nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.
NARRATOR: Two investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela on charges of capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.
NARRATOR: A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.
INTERVIEWER: Would you have done something differently?
HARRIS: There is not a thing that comes to mind.
NARRATOR: Only 18% said the economy is in excellent or good condition.
NARRATOR: US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.
NARRATOR: The cost of homes have spiked. Home buyers need to earn 80% more than they did in 2020 to afford a house.
INTERVIEWER: Were you the last person in the room?
HARRIS [?]: Yes.
[end of video]
TRUMP: So North Carolina, if you want to end this disaster, you must go out. Just go out and vote. We got to win this. We got to get this thing. We're pleased to be joined tonight by some really great people, and one of them I'm very proud of. He's done a great job as your senator, Ted Budd. [cheers and applause] Where is Ted? Ted. Thank you, Ted. You're doing a great job. He's doing a great job. Proud of you. Ted, really good. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a warrior. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Virginia. Thank you. Congressman Dan Bishop. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Dan. A man who's been really fantastic. All I know is they had more people show up in the last four days than in 2016 or 2020. And many of these people lost their homes. They lost everything. And we had more people. We set a record. Can you believe that? That shows enthusiasm. [cheers and applause]
That shows—North Carolina GOP Chair, Jason Simmons. Thank you, Jason. Great job. How are we doing, Jason? We're going to win the state big, I hope, three times in a row, right? Jason's great. A great friend of mine, and really a friend of my boy, Don, Addison McDowell. He's going to do a fantastic job. [cheers and applause] Thank you, Addison. Oh, you're looking better and better. Look at you. Looks like a real congressman. He is going to be fantastic. Somebody that I've got a lot of respect for, I have for a long time. From the day I met him, I respect him. He was a very successful businessman. He was a great senator. He is a very special guy. David Perdue. David? [cheers and applause] Thank you, David. Thanks.
One of the biggest and best developers around, a man who's made a lot of money and he's very generous, including with North Carolina. He writes a check for everything. He's just a great person, a very generous man. Steve Witkoff. [cheers and applause] Steve, thank you for the help. Thank you. And Peter Navarro, I hope you heard from him. [cheers and applause] This guy is great. They say threat to democracy. They're a threat to democracy. Nobody would've done what they did to him. Nobody would've done what they did to Peter Navarro. He fought for our country so hard. I was witness to it for four years. That guy fought harder than anybody I know. And then they did what they did to him. They're a bunch of bad people. [booing]
They weaponized the Justice Department. They weaponized the FBI. And I've had more investigations than any human being, including Alphonse Capone, the meanest, the Scarface. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. They even raided my house, little place on the beach called Mar-a-Lago. No, but think of it. They raided my house. Can you believe—this is the scum that we have to deal with? This is the scum. What they did to him and other of our friends and friends of the people in this room. It's a disgrace. And Peter, you're going to go down as a hero. You watch. You watch. [cheers and applause] Thank you. And we also have former Democrat Congresswoman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, a woman that everybody loves. I watched her years ago where she just had so much common sense. We're the party of common sense. I like to say it because it's true. We don't want men playing in women's sports. We want to have borders. We want to have fair elections. Little things like that. Common sense, right? But she's here tonight, and I'm going to just ask her to come up and say a couple of words. Tulsi Gabbard. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TULSI! TULSI! TULSI
TULSI GABBARD: Thank you very much. Aloha.
CROWD: ALOHA!
GABBARD: You know, I was a Democrat for over 20 years. Today's Democrat—Thank you. Today's Democrat party is completely unrecognizable, which points to the clear choice that we have in this election today. When you look at the party of Kamala Harris, for example, she is anti-freedom, she is pro-censorship, she is pro-open borders, and she is pro-war, without even pretending to care about peace. As President Trump talked about, she has shamelessly embraced the endorsement and support of warmongers like Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, and others who care more about power and feeding the military industrial complex than they care about you, the American people, and peace.
President Trump has pledged to end wars, not start them. [cheers and applause] And this is why in the eyes of the Kamala Harris Dick Cheney Democrat party, they will do everything possible to try to destroy him. You'll see how they have weaponized the federal government. They have weaponized law enforcement, the Department of Justice. They have done everything possible to try to silence him, to try to remove him from the ballot so we the people don't even have the choice to who we want to vote for. Why have they done this? Because this man has the courage to take them on and root out the deep rot of corruption in the swamp in Washington. [cheers and applause] Now, voters have made their voices heard loud and clear, not once, not twice, but three times in the last three presidential elections, nominating this man to be the Republican nominee for president because of his commitment to these fundamental American principles of freedom and peace and prosperity. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
GABBARD: USA.
CROWD: USA! USA! USA!
GABBARD: Now, to those of you here, or those watching at home, who are independent-minded people like myself who love our country and are committed to the constitution and to freedom, the Democrat party has no home for people like us. But we do have a home in the Republican Party where we are welcomed with open arms by President Trump and so many of you who love our country. [cheers and applause] And it is because of my love for our country, and specifically because of the leadership that President Trump has brought to transform the Republican Party and bring it back to the party of the people and the party of peace, that I'm proud to stand here with you today, President Trump, and announce that I'm joining the Republican Party. [cheers and applause]
I am joining the party of the people, the party of equality, the party that was founded to fight against and end slavery in this country. It is the party of common sense and the party that is led by a president who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. [cheers and applause] So as we stand here today, we have 14 days until the most historic election of our lives. And my message to my fellow Americans, regardless of your political affiliation, now is the time for us to stand together to save our country. [cheers and applause] There is nothing less than that. That's on the line.
A vote for President Trump is a vote for a big open tent party that welcomes people from all backgrounds in all walks of life. [cheers and applause] A vote for President Trump is a vote to express our deep love for our country and our appreciation for our God-given rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. [cheers and applause] A vote for President Trump is a vote for secure borders and safe communities. And a vote for President Trump is a vote for peace here in America and around the world. [cheers and applause] I am looking forward to casting my vote for President Trump because you are our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. [cheers and applause] Every single vote will count. This is our opportunity to vote for freedom, to vote for peace, to vote for America, and vote for President Trump to go back to the White House and make America great again. Thank you so much. [cheers and applause]
CROWD: TULSI! TULSI! TULSI!
TRUMP: Wow, I didn't know that. I didn't know that. Thank you very much. Tulsi, that's great. Wow. That was a surprise. That was really—She's been independent for a long time. That's a great thing, a great honor. Thank you very much, Tulsi. [cheers and applause] And what a beautiful speech she made, right? Wasn't that beautiful? I'd like to also honor somebody who really has gone through a lot, and I hope he's going to really be helping us a lot. He's got some tremendous ideas for making us healthy and well, and that's RFK Jr. [cheers and applause] He's a very special guy and I just want to thank him because he came in at the same time as Tulsi, and he's got some incredible thing on your health, on women's health, and all of the different elements. I may have to fight him a little bit on the environment, because we have to run this country so well, but that's okay. But he's really an outstanding guy and it was not an easy decision for him, certainly. But RFK Jr. thank you very much. [cheers and applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.
So here are the facts on Kamala, just in wrapping it up. Oh, you thought he was here? No he wasn't. I just wondered. No. In spirit, I can guarantee you he's here. I'll bring him to the next one, but you won't be here. No, he's great. He's got some really incredible ideas and he's so committed, it's incredible, so thank you very much to Bobby.
But here are the facts on Kamala Harris. She's a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund the Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police, even for a day or a week, is not worthy of being President of the United States. Can't be. [cheers and applause] Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. ICE, these are great, powerful people, strong people, because that's their job. They have to get some of the worst gang members and drug dealers and everything else out of our country. I know a lot of great tough people right here, but they don't want that job. But she wants to get rid of them. She wants to take them out. We're not taking them out. We're going to make them bigger and stronger because we have a lot of work to do in cleaning up our country and making our country safe.
She vowed repeatedly to ban fracking as California Attorney General. You know this. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as a totally nonviolent crime. Think of that. And she pledged—She's so far left. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. [booing] You know that—you know that as soon as that comes up, she will guaranteed confiscate your guns. And she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention, all at taxpayer expense. And as you know, we had a little trip to McDonald's a couple of days ago—[cheers and applause] and she lied about working at McDonald's. It was a part of her story. ""I worked over the French fries,"" so I decided to see what it was like.
And those French fries were good. They were right out of whatever the hell they may come out of. No, but think of it. And the press refuses to acknowledge it. They refuse to cover it. They have tried. McDonald's denies it. And she never worked there. She never worked there. Some people went and really did spend a lot of time on it. No, she lied and she's a liar. And on top of all of this, Kamala turned our military as woke as it can be, which is not woke because they are great. What they did for me with ISIS was—These are not woke people. But take a look.

[cheers and applause]
TRUMP: Thank you. You got to remember, we won two world wars. We won a lot of things. Well, most recently we did defeat ISIS and they said that couldn't be done. It was going to take five years. It took four weeks. We have a great military and they're not woke. Some of the stupid people up top are woke, but they're not woke. You couldn't make them woke if you tried. You couldn't make them. You could put them in what's called a woke cage for two years and they'd come out fighting, believe me. So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala Harris and we are going to save America. [cheers and applause] With your support, we will cut your taxes and inflation slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to North Carolina. They're coming back. [cheers and applause]
We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American again. I will end the war in Ukraine very quickly. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. We're so close. The biggest risk is this number of months before January 20th. We will crush the violent crime that's plaguing our cities and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect they so dearly deserve. They will stop the crime. [cheers and applause] We will strengthen and modernize our military. We rebuilt the entire military, and then a lot of our military was given to Afghanistan. Isn't that nice? Think of that. How about that? That was the most embarrassing moment in the history. 13 dead soldiers, many, many horrifically wounded with arms and legs obliterated. They gave billions of dollars of equipment. They didn't take Bagram, the air base. They should have kept Bagram. It's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear missiles. Isn't that nice? They didn't take it.
And we left people behind. We left Americans behind. They moved the military out first. A child. You know, I had one of the rallies and I had his little five or six-year-old boy in the front row. And I called him up to the stage. His mother was horrified. I understand that. But he was up here, little kid. And I said—I gave him the facts in about two minutes. I said, ""Would you move the military out first or last?"" ""I'd move the military out last, sir."" These stupid people moved the military out first. And you know, I didn't lose one soldier in 18 months. [cheers and applause] I had a talk with Abdul, who was the head of the Taliban. Abdul. Still there. He's still the head. And we had a talk because they were killing a lot of our soldiers with sniper fire and other things, and a lot of them with Obama and Biden, but basically Obama. I don't think Biden knew where the hell he was then either. So they were killing our soldiers. And I told them, I don't have to get into the conversation, for 18 months we didn't lose one soldier.
Then we had a tragic election. Tragic. Think of our country. We wouldn't have had inflation. Least importantly, we wouldn't have had inflation, but we wouldn't have had Russia going into Ukraine. Zero chance. Zero. Wouldn't have ever happened. And it didn't happen for four years. Even the Democrats, most of them agreed, the honest ones, which there aren't too many of them. But even they say wouldn't have happened. And October 7th with Israel would've never happened. They wouldn't have killed all those people. Those people were killed. And the hostages, now they're waiting for the hostages. There won't be many hostages. They're not going to be a lot of hostages. Those people are probably long gone. I've been saying that for a long time. That's part of the problem. The other side doesn't know what to do because they don't have the hostages. It's a very sad situation. That would've never happened. All these things would've never happened.
Think of the difference in the world. Viktor Orban, the head of Hungary, Prime Minister of Hungary, very powerful guy. He said—They asked him, they said to him, ""What's going on in the world? It's blowing up in the Middle East. It's blowing up with Russia, Ukraine. What's going on? You didn't have any of this stuff when Trump was here. What is going on?"" He said, ""The problem is you don't have Trump. You put Trump back, it's all going to be better. They would've never done this with Trump as president."" It's interesting. [cheers and applause] Right? Peter knows. Right, Peter? We will build a missile defense shield all around our country. [cheers and applause]We're going to be safe. We're going to be made in the USA. It's going to be made in North Carolina, partially. We'll land an American astronaut on Mars and we'll call Elon. Let's get going. We want to do that, but we really want to.
And as part of that, we were in big trouble in space. China was lapping us, and Russia was lapping us. And I created Space Force. And now we're lapping the whole world with Space Force. They've done a great job. [applause] Part of that whole thing is about military and military protection. It's going to be a very important. It's going to be one of the really best decisions we ever made, doing Space Force. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. [cheers and applause]
And we're going to go to Congress and ask very strongly, because that little riot that they had three months ago, they were burning American flags all over the place. We're going to ask Congress to—They say it's unconstitutional. I disagree. To give a one-year prison sentence for anybody burning the American flag. [cheers and applause] Early on. That's right. That's very nice. Very good. You came prepared. Look at you. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools. [cheers and applause] And we will keep men out of women's sports. [cheers and applause] I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment. [cheers and applause] After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country and defend our borders and protect our citizens. [cheers and applause] And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all and it will be stopped. And again, we're going to let people into our country, but they're going to come into our country legally. [cheers and applause] We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper. Every family will thrive and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left lunatic agenda. And we have to have a landslide of an election that's too big to rig. [cheers and applause] You have to get out. You got to get out. Early. Voting is underway. So get everyone, get your friends, get your family. Get Alice to get her husband who just will not get off that couch.
""Come on, Jack. Let's go. Jack, you got to do it, Jack. You can do it. Turn off the television just for an hour. We'll be right back. Jack. Turn off that football game. It doesn't really mean anything, Jack."" Especially with the new kickoff return. Did you ever see anything so stupid in your life? [laughing] They have to ruin things at work. Is that the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen?
After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country. With your help now until election day, we will redeem America's promise. We will put America first and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And we will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. And we will never, ever, ever, ever surrender. [cheers and applause] Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. [cheers and applause] November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, we will make America powerful again, make America wealthy again, make America healthy again. Come on, Bobby. Bobby's going to do it. Bobby. Let's go, Bobby. You're going to make us healthy, Bobby. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. [cheers and applause] Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you.

    Interview on ""The Joe Rogan Experience""
  


  

  
    October 25, 2024  

  
    ROGAN: All right, we're rolling.
TRUMP: Let's go.
ROGAN: Good to see you. Here we go. One of the things I wanted to talk to you about, I wanted to play this, but we decided we shouldn't play it because it could get copyright strike and we don't want to get the episode—We don't want anybody to have any sort of way to get it down.
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: But it was the episode of you when you were on The Vies, and I think it was 2015 or 2016, like when you were running for President and you got introduced as, ""Our friend, Donald Trump.""
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: Whoopi Goldberg gives you a big hug and a kiss. Joy Behar gives you a big hug. Barbara Walters gives you a big hug. They all loved you. They were all talking about how your—you might be conservative in your financial positions, but you're very liberal socially. They were talking about you in such a favorable light. The audience was cheering and then you actually started winning in the polls and then the machine started working towards you.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But it's, there's probably no one in history that I've ever seen that's been attacked the way you've been attacked and the way they've done it so coordinated and systematically and when you see those same people in the past very favorable to you, like Oprah when you were on Oprah's Show.
TRUMP: Very.
ROGAN: She was encouraging you to be President.
TRUMP: Last week, I did one of her last shows. I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal being on Oprah's Show, the last one. And I was like one of the last shows in that final week and I said, ""Boy, we've come a long since that.""
ROGAN: What was it like?
TRUMP: Well, the concept, it was really like two different lives. I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons and we had actually 14 seasons, 12 years over—They had a couple of them—
ROGAN: Well, they canceled the Apprentice when you were running for President, correct?
TRUMP: No, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that and I had enough of it and we did great. It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, ""We're gonna give you a contract."" They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy. Then they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, ""You're crazy. Don't run, don't run. Nobody gives up prime time,"" they said. It's one of those little things, which is probably true for the most—
ROGAN: Nobody gives up prime time though for being President?
TRUMP: Well, for running against 20 some odd people. You know, turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, ""Who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot."" Actually the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy, all top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it 'cause they wanted to have me extend. The Apprentice was doing well, so it was 14 seasons, it was 12 years. We had one, two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show, and I said, ""I want to do this."" What happened is previously, like three years, four years before that they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney and somehow they put me in a poll and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard frankly. But I blew everybody away and I said, ""That's interesting, 'cause I never really gave it that much real thought.""
I thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good and so I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice, plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly and it was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that. I got them done. I had some very good successes and I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster and I ran, and I won against Hillary and it was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right, The Vies, I was on The Vies many, many times and they loved me.
ROGAN: Just the way people would talk. I mean, even if people had criticisms about you, people that didn't like you, there was always feuds and stuff like that, but the reality was the thing turned on you when they found out that you were gonna be President. It was very coordinated and some people are catching on to that now. There's a lot of people that were longtime Democrats like Elon and Bill Ackman and all these different very intelligent people.
TRUMP: And they support me now. Bill Ackman—
ROGAN: And they support you now.
TRUMP:—supports me.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: He's been very supportive too.
ROGAN: This is what I wanted to ask you. What was it like when you actually got in? 'Cause nobody really can prepare you for that when you're running for President, you don't really know what it's gonna be like when you actually get into office. What was, what did you think it was gonna be like?
TRUMP: Do you mean in office or when I decided to run?
ROGAN: No, when you got in.
TRUMP: Oh, when I was.
ROGAN: When you got in.
TRUMP: So when I was in and won and was in The White House essentially.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: Well, first of all it was very surreal. It's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, it's a—
ROGAN: Ears bleed a lot, yeah.
TRUMP: Anyway. So, and I was thinking the other day—when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said, I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience, okay.
ROGAN: What's day one like? You win, you get inaugurated. ""Holy shit, I'm the President.""
TRUMP: Yeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I had just built a building on Pennsyl—you know, the hotel, the old post office it was. We called it Trump National Hotel and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria, and it was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military, you know, it was a major thing. I got off, really the first time I used Air Force One, landed and we're coming down and it was very beauti—I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. Normally you're used to going one way and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up and I wanted to go out and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, the kids, little bit dangerous when you watch like Kennedy and some others, but I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.
And so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do. And Melania got out with a beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. It was, uh, people loved it and Barron and we're walking down the street. But where it really got amazing, we get to The White House and now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful. And we went up to the President's quarters, they call them the Presidential quarters and I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. It's funny. Nobody ever talks about The White House as being beautiful inside. You think it's all, everything's gonna all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide. The ceiling heights are, everythin—It's so beautiful. But I was standing there and I said to the guys, ""I want to see the Lincoln bedroom.""
I had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom. And I was standing with my wife. I said, ""Do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom."" I mean, it was, like, it was amazing because it's, look, if you love the country, but here you are, the Lincoln bedroom. And the bed, you know he was very tall. He was six foot six, which then would be like, like Barron. Would be like Barron Trump. He's 6'9, but six foot six, he was very tall. Then on top of that, he wore—
ROGAN: There it is.
TRUMP:—that. Yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed. And because people were shorter then. You see, some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground actually. But he had the long bed and they had, uh you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address, and this is the original, and I'm looking and I just looked around. I said, ""Do you believe this?"" Because I was never a pol—First of all, even if you were a politician. But I was never a politician. I sort of just started, right.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And all of a sudden I'm standing in The White House. And it was uh, very very surreal. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. You know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed, you could see it was a little bit longer, had to be a little bit longer. Uh, he lost his son and the two of them suffered from melancholia. They didn't call it depression, they called it melancholia and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son whose name was Tad. Tad. And uh, and just seeing it, and the little picture. There's a little tiny picture.
I mean, you can't see the details there, little, tiny—everything the way it was—a little tiny picture of Tad who he lost, and it was devastating. And he was in a war and he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row. And he was getting a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff, but like I went to a UFC fight and it was a champion who was 14 and 1 about a year ago, you would know the names, 14 and 1, and the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like, almost just an average fighter. He lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy. So I said, ""Okay-""
ROGAN: I really don't know who you're talking about. I'm trying to—
TRUMP: I will figure it out.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: But about a year ago—But the point is that he lost. He wasn't nearly the fighter as the one—But the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten, he's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before. And then he said, ""I'll take the guy that won the other fight."" And that's what happened. He beat him a second time.
ROGAN: Sometimes psychological advantages.
TRUMP: Yeah. What is this crazy thing? Lincoln had a—uh, I don't know, I've never read this. I heard it from people in The White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of The White House. But Lincoln had the yips, about, in a way, as the golfers would say. He had a phobia about Robert E. Lee. He said, ""I can't beat Robert,"" because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of—They tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, ""No, I have to be with my state.""
The state was his whole thing and he went to the South. And, he was, uh I've had generals tell me—We have some great generals. The real generals, not the ones you see on television. The ones that beat Isis, with me. We defeated Isis in record time. It was supposed to take years and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals. These are tough guys. These are not woke guys. But their favorite general in terms of genius was Robert E. Lee. He took a war—
ROGAN: In terms of strategy, you mean?
TRUMP: Strategically. He took a war that should have been over in a few days and it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war. And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. I ran, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, uh, I guess if you figured, max it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office. And I did well. I mean I, I went into debates. We had 18 people including me, and then slowly but surely they started to disappear. We had debates, good debates.
ROGAN: Everyone's aware of all this stuff. But what I want to get to is what was the experience once you got inside?
TRUMP: It was just—
ROGAN: Like, what did you think it was gonna be like in terms of your ability to govern? This is your first experience governing anything. You've never been a governor, you've never been a mayor—
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Private stuff.
ROGAN: Business.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But now all of a sudden you're inside The White House.
TRUMP: The biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed—It was really a hallowed place to me. It was—
ROGAN: Surreal.
TRUMP:—beyond—To me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience. And then with time that wears off. With time, it becomes your place where you stay.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And I was doing a lot of—I had two things that I really focused on, governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden—I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And, and you see that, I mean, you see we're in The Washington Post very early on. They said, ""Well now the impeachment stuff starts."" And it did. I mean it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival, they get in.
ROGAN: What did you expect though, in terms of once you got inside you had to appoint all these people? How many appointments did you have to make with a very short amount of time?
TRUMP: You have actually 10,000 appointments. Now, they're different. You have big ones and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people. But the President really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a Secretary of State and he, he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot. But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones. Treasury, State, military.
ROGAN: And how did you know who to appoint?
TRUMP: Well, I didn't. I had no experience—
ROGAN: You didn't.
TRUMP: You have to understand, Joe—
ROGAN: Right. So are you going—
TRUMP: I was there 17 times in Washington and I never stayed over. According to the press, which I think is probably right. Over the years I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying, ""This place is gorgeous, but, you know, I don't know anybody."" It's like you, you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great now, we got to fix it, we're gonna make it better. A very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're gonna make it great. We're gonna make it better. We're gonna bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was a New York guy. I was a New York builder and I built buildings in New York and I knew that whole world, but I didn't know the Washington world too well. And all of a sudden you're supposed to be appointing top people. So—
ROGAN: What did you think it was gonna be like? Did you have any ideas of what it was gonna be like and what was different?
TRUMP: Well, I was always involved in politics, but usually from the standpoint of a donor.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I was a donor. I was a big donor. I gave money to politicians. I enjoyed politicians—
ROGAN: Mostly Democrats, right?
TRUMP: Both, really. Pretty much both. I have actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and me when I was very young.
ROGAN: Well, you were a Democrat until what year?
TRUMP: I was a Democrat, um, I could get you the exact, but the early nineties. The early nineties. I switched over eventually. Actually they had a Reform Party. I was thinking about doing that for a little while, but then fortunately I didn't because it's very hard. You know, it's a two-party system. And anytime you hear third party, I know you like RFK Jr. and so do I, he's a fantastic guy.
ROGAN: I do. But—
TRUMP: But that whole thing is very tough.
ROGAN:—I thought that thing, being an independent was nonsense.
TRUMP: It doesn't work because even if you do great, you're not gonna get Congress. In other words, you need now to say, ""Okay, now I'll get half of Congress."" They're never gonna vote for you. So even if you got there, which is very hard, and I know how you feel about Bobby and I feel the same way, and he's now with us. But doesn't w—it's pure and simple. It's a two-party system. And somebody, I won't mention his name, but somebody spent $250 million trying to get the nomination as a Reform Party candidate or whatever, and they got just nowhere. You get eaten, just get eaten. The system eats you alive.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: So, uh, it was really somebody that not only was new to Washington, but was new to politics. So in the office of the presidency, over the years, all those Presidents you've had 92% were politicians and 8% were Generals, General Eisenhower, General Washington, right. General George Washington. You had Generals. So it's 8% Generals, no Admirals. 8% Generals and 92% politicians. You know, they're politicians and they go on. So they never had a business guy or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office. They were all, like, Ronald Reagan was really, he was a movie actor, but he became the Governor of California for, I think, two terms, and then he ran. So you'd never had a thing like this. But I uh, in terms of me, and sometimes I'd use it as an excuse, and I don't like having excuses actually, but I'd use it as an excuse. I had to rely on people that I respected or liked, but that I didn't know that well because I didn't know them that well.
Some of those people I campaigned against 'cause when you have 18 people, we had mostly politicians running in the election, you know, running in the primaries, and they got knocked out one by one. But I got to like some of them, some of them I didn't like at all. I don't like them now. And I'd rely on them and I'd rely on other people. So all of a sudden people would come in, I'd like to recommend so-and-so to be Secretary of State, and I'd have three, four people recommend—One thing I can tell you, Joe, everybody wants the position.
ROGAN: Of course.
TRUMP: No, no. But sometimes they'll hear, ""A lot of people don't want to work with Trump because Trump is tough to work with, et cetera."" Let me tell you, everybody wants to be any one of these positions. They'd die for it.
ROGAN: Of course.
TRUMP: Now they don't want to be known. I mean, there's a particular guy in New York, primarily. Very big, very big, very successful, very strong, very political, although he is not a politician. He'd give anything to be Secretary of State. But if they ask him, ""No, I don't think I would do it."" But in the meantime, begging for it. Okay, begging.
ROGAN: I believe you.
TRUMP: Look, everybody wants it.
ROGAN: But what I wanted to get to—
TRUMP: And by the way, no matter what you do—But it's very dangerous to pick somebody outside of a politician because a politician has been basically vetted for years. You pick a business guy and they've never been vetted at all, and they're you know, the head of a big company or something, but they've never been vetted, you know nothing about his personal life, you know nothing about where he's been. When you put him in, it's a little bit dangerous because all of a sudden they get checked up and you hear things that you say, ""Wow, this is not gonna work out too well."" So it's very dangerous. Picking people that are outside of politics is somewhat dangerous.
ROGAN: So you're kind of stuck in a position where you have to pick established people. Then the problem with established people is established people are already indoctrinated into the system.
TRUMP: And they're stiffs in many cases.
ROGAN: Stiffs.
TRUMP: Stiffs. They're survivors. I find that uh, you know—
ROGAN: What do you mean by stiffs? When you say stiffs—
TRUMP: A stiff. They don't have—They have nothing. Or they're smart and survivor—One little thing. So there was a congressman years before I ran, and I was very close to him and I needed a license on something and he was very important in getting the license. But it was a little bit controversial, the license, this particular thing that was being licensed. But I was close to this guy and helped him and everything else, and I went to him. I said, ""I'd like to have you help."" And he said, ""Let me take a look at it."" I said, ""Ooh, that's not too good, but I really hope you're gonna help."" Anyway, he tapped me along for a long period of time and ultimately didn't do it. And I said, ""You are a stiff. You could have done this thing so easy,"" et cetera. But it was controversial. He was in Congress for many years, like 28 years. And, you know, there's a reason when somebody's there for 28 years, you got to be sort of smart.
ROGAN: Right. A survivor.
TRUMP: You have all the scandals. And I realized he was a survivor.
ROGAN: And so they never do anything controversial.
TRUMP: Well, they don't do—
ROGAN: They never take any chances or speak—
TRUMP: Yeah, they don't take—
ROGAN:—their opinion. It's outside of the—
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: And yet I don't disrespect him for it. I actually respected the guy more in a certain way. I said—
ROGAN: 'Cause he did survive.
TRUMP:—""You know what, he's been there for 28 years and he made it through."" A lot of people don't make it through. They don't last long.""
ROGAN: It's a good way for non-exceptional people to survive.
TRUMP: Well, it is. It certainly is.
ROGAN: So you're in there, you have 10,000 appointments you have to make. Like, so you're getting advice from people. And, at what point in time—did you have a moment in time where you realized, like uh, these are bad choices, like, ""Some of these people I shouldn't have had in there""?
TRUMP: Oh, yeah. I think—so the one question that you'll ask me, that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask, and I always come up with the same answer. Ahh, if—the one mistake, 'cause I had a lot of success, great economy, great everything. Everything was great. The military, we rebuilt it. Biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did—We had a great presidency. Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young, this way they're there for 50 years, right.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: So, even if a President is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was sort of the luck of the draw, but I will say that it always comes back to the same answer. The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people. I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked and—
ROGAN: Neocons?
TRUMP: Neocons or bad people or disloyal people or—
ROGAN: People that were just bad—
TRUMP:—people that were into the—You got the—
ROGAN: You got bad advice?
TRUMP: Yeah, I mean, look, you're reading about them a little bit today, A guy like Kelly who was a bully, a bully but a weak person. You know more about bullies than anybody probably around 'cause you deal in a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly. But, you know, he's bad. Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton. You know John Bolton?
ROGAN: Mm-hmm.
TRUMP: A friend of mine called me up. I was picking Bolton, and he's a very smart guy. His name is Phil Ruffin. He's a very rich guy from Las Vegas. One of the—he's a great card player. He doesn't play cards, but he's a great play—He's just a natural, got poker sense, right. The good old poker sense. And Phil Ruffin is a very, very wise kind of a guy and very, one of the richest people around, and has had great success and understands people, so, it was in that I was picking Bolton or I picked Bolton, he called up, he said, ""Don't pick him."" ""Why?"" ""He's a bad guy."" Now, he wasn't in politics at all. He's in various businesses. He said, ""He's a bad guy. He's just—It always works out bad with that guy.""
I said, ""Oh man, I wish you told me this two weeks ago. I already hired him. He's here."" And, and he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, ""Oh man, Trump's gonna go to war with us. He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East, they shoulda never done it. I used to say it as a civilian. So I always got more publicity than other people. And it wasn't like I was trying. In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me why.
ROGAN: Oh, I could definitely tell you. You said a lot of wild shit.
TRUMP: Maybe. Maybe I did.
ROGAN: You said a lot of wild shit.
TRUMP: Maybe that's it.
ROGAN: And then CNN in all their brilliance by highlighting your wild shit made you much more popular.
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah.
ROGAN: And they boosted you in the polls 'cause people were tired of someone talking in this bullshit pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn't agree with you, they at least knew, ""Whoever that guy is. That's him. That's really him."" When you see certain people talk, certain people in the public eye, you don't know who they are. You have no idea who they are. It's very difficult to know. You see them in conversations, they have these pre-planned answers. They say everything. It's very rehearsed. You never get to the meat of it.
One of the beautiful things about you is that you freeball, you get out and you do these huge events and you're just talking and you're making—We've highlighted you on the show many times when you did this Biden impression where he's walking around and he doesn't know what he's doing—
TRUMP: It scares—
ROGAN: It's stand up. It's funny stuff, but it's like you—And you were making fun of Elon one time. You were doing an Elon impression. It's great. You have, like, comedic instincts. Like when you said to Hillary, ""You'd be in jail."" That's great timing.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: But it's like that kind of stuff was unheard of as a politician. Like, no one had done that. And I think—
TRUMP: It's funny, you need at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business. This is a very dangerous business first of all. It's a very tough business. When—
ROGAN: It's the most dangerous business.
TRUMP: Yeah. It's the most—well, for a job?
ROGAN: Yes. I mean, other than—
TRUMP: This is the far—
ROGAN:—going to war and being a firefighter or being a cop, it's the most dangerous business because—
TRUMP: It's the most dangerous. Being President is the most dangerous—
ROGAN: Especially you. I mean—
TRUMP: I'm much more [inaudible]—
ROGAN: You haven't even got to the election, there's been two assassination attempts. And they've brushed those out of the news like it was nothing.
TRUMP: Yeah, they'd rather not talk about them.
ROGAN: Imagine if there was assassination attempts on Biden, how hard people would be attacking the right. How they would be trying to get guns taken away from people, they would try to ramp up gun laws. They would try to figure out some way to blame you. If there was a tax on—if Biden got shot in the ear, we would've never heard the end of it.
TRUMP: But I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential Presidents. If you take a look at what's happened, look, I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions even, dollars. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Nobody took in 10 cents. Not one other President. I do things that make it, I mean don't necessarily make me so popular. I just do what's right. And when you do that, you know, you're more—Look at Iran. Iran—we would've never had the attack on Israel at all. Iran was broke. I told China, ""If you buy, you can't do business in the United States under any circum—"" We we're gonna go cold Turkey with China. Some people think that would've been a good idea anyway. But, ""If you buy any oil, one barrel of oil from them, you're not doing business."" I said that to many countries. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no mon—But I make myself—you know, I mean, I understand what I'm doing. You make yourself a target and it's a very dangerous business. But, if you just look at statistically, so I, I sort of think, I don't know if it's right, but one-tenth of 1% for a race car driver, it's a pretty dangerous business, right.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: One tenth of 1% for a bull rider. I tell you to me, I—
ROGAN: You talking death?
TRUMP: These guys that ride the bulls is worse than UFC.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: These guys. You see these big monster bulls and you see it in slow motion where the foot is like an inch away from the head. If it hits them, the guy's gone. But they die. They die.
ROGAN: So one tenth of 1% die, is that what you're saying?
TRUMP: Yeah, yeah. One tenth of 1% die.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: And they certainly get hurt badly. Really, I mean, they can't walk after a certain period of time. But with a President, if you look at the assassination—
ROGAN: The amount of assassination attempts—
TRUMP:—and attempts too. And attempts. No, it's a very dangerous position. I never thought of that, by the way, when I did it. You know, you don't tend to—I don't think of—
ROGAN: Did you just assume because people loved you on the Apprentice, they were gonna love you as a President?
TRUMP: Well, I think it would be so easy. You know, it was very interesting—
ROGAN: Well, it probably would have been if the media didn't attack you the way they did. If they didn't conflate you with Hitler. I mean, even today, like, Kamala was talking about you and Hitler. You, they're gonna take what you said about Robert E. Lee. ""Oh, Donald Trump wishes the South won.""
TRUMP: ""Oh, he loves Robert E. Lee."" That's right. ""He loves Robert E. Lee.""
ROGAN: They love to take things out of context and distort things.
TRUMP: Well, they don't even have to take them out. They make them up entirely.
ROGAN: They do that too.
TRUMP: But you know, it's interesting when you mentioned—I was very popular and, and all those people love me. I mean, this uh, some of these women, they're, they're so stupid—And Joy, she would, every time she'd see me, I'd be in the theater or something and she goes, ""You have to be on the show again. Come on, come on, let's go. We have to.""
ROGAN: She loved you.
TRUMP: Loved me.
ROGAN: That episode where—
TRUMP: By the way—
ROGAN: People should watch that episode just to see what we're talking about. Like I said, we don't want to get a copyright strike, so we're not gonna put it up, but—
TRUMP: It's okay.
ROGAN:—if you watch the episode, it's bananas. It's like an alternative universe. And it's only—
TRUMP: But Whoopi loved me.
ROGAN:—nine years ago.
TRUMP: Whoopi loved me.
ROGAN: Loved you. Gives you a hug and a kiss.
TRUMP: And how about that other one, the new one on there, the one from my Administration? She writes me a letter, ""You're the greatest President."" She leaves. She worked as an Assistant Press Secretary. I hardly knew her, but she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter. What's her name? She was—I don't even know. You know, anyway, she was in the Administration, she's on now currently, sits in the far right-hand side, whatever the hell her name is, and she writes a letter, the most beautiful letter—she's quoted in the paper, ""He's a consequential, he was the greatest President, ba, ba, ba."" Then all of a sudden she goes on The View, she started hitting the hell out of me because they won't hire her unless. I've had many people go on CNN and they called and said, ""I don't know what to do. They want to pay me a lot, but I have to be negative on you."" I said, ""Be negative. That's okay."" There were guys on like CNN, they won't hire them. Sean Duffy is a, you know, congressman and he retired. He got a good job with CNN, but he was only positive about Trump. So they kept him, but they would never put him on. I mean, I respect what he did. He could have gone, you know, negative. I tell people, go negative. Let my friends make the money. It's so crooked. The press is so crooked.
ROGAN: It's crooked, but it's also, they're diminishing themselves.
TRUMP: They're hurting themselves.
ROGAN: They're killing all their credibility and it's opening up their credibility to new media. It's opening up their credibility to independent media. All these—
TRUMP: The worst I've ever seen though, and I've seen the worst. I mean, I've been a part of it. I've been—I've seen the worst. Kamala goes on 60 Minutes, gave an answer that a child wouldn't give. It was so bad. And 60 Minutes took the answer out. They took the whole and they put another answer in—
ROGAN: They edited it deceptively.
TRUMP:—which didn't make sense either, but it was better. They took the—Well, it wasn't editing, it was fraud. This was not editing. Editing is where I'll give an answer and they'll take a couple of words and change it around. Or they might even take a sentence or two off, which is very bad, but, that, it's sort of bad. I'd give an answer, which was a very good answer. I always talk about, you know, I like to give along the weave. I like to—
ROGAN: Yeah, you like to weave things in.
TRUMP: Yeah. But when you do the weaves, and you have to be very smart to do weaves, when you do the weave—look at this. Just in this one thing we're talking about little pieces [inaudible] but it always ends up—
ROGAN: Uh-huh. Got to get it back to home.
TRUMP: No, no. It comes back home for the right people. For the wrong people, it doesn't come back home and they end up in the wilderness, right? But, but they can take my answer. And you know what? They may take a little piece of it out or something and they use the term, yes, we want to save time. Well, it's not it but I've never heard—I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history what happened to CNS—CBS. So you have CBS 60 Minutes. That's a news program. It's not an entertainment program. It's under their news. It's the head of their news thing. She gives an answer that was, that shows that she's essentially incompetent and they took the answer. Could you imagine them doing that for me?
ROGAN: We can show it if you want people to see it. Can we show it?
TRUMP: Go ahead, sure.
ROGAN: No. We'll get in trouble. We'll get copyright strike.
ROGAN STAFF [inaudible]
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: I'll indemnify.
ROGAN: Listen, anyone can find it but it's drastic. But what was interesting was the other full version was available initially. It was like a preview.
TRUMP: Somebody made a big mistake.
ROGAN: Somebody put that preview out there and then—
TRUMP: Some kid put the preview out.
ROGAN: Exactly.
TRUMP: And then the bosses did this or that and then all of a sudden said, ""We got a problem.""
ROGAN: Exactly. And then it became—
TRUMP: They got caught by mistake. But don't you think that's a—To me, and don't forget, this is election interference and fraud and it's 60 Minutes. It's their news division. So—
ROGAN: It's a big deal.
TRUMP: They give those licenses out, Joe, for free. They should pay a fortune. They're worth a fortune. They give them out for free because they're using the public airwaves. With cable, you don't have that. Cable's different, but, you know, it's just a different deal. But with the networks, they give those license. They're worth billions of dollars. They give them out free but you have to be honest and all, that was bad.
I think that David Muir and that woman that was aside, I never even heard of her, but they kept interrupting me. It was like I said, ""How many people am I debating here? I got this one and I got you two."" But he went after me 11 different times. You know, it's interesting. I always thought he was a nice guy, but he's just like the rest of them, you know?
ROGAN: Well, that's his job, unfortunately. And I'm sure what they want—
TRUMP: No, but not when they're wrong.
ROGAN: You're right. Well, the problem was they fact-checked you and they didn't fact-check her.
TRUMP: Not at and all.
ROGAN: One of the most egregious examples of that was when she said that there is—there are no troops right now deployed in war zones. There's a very famous viral video that went online of troops in a war zone saying, ""Well, what the fuck are we then?"" Because there's thousands of them. Dan Crenshaw, the congressman posted on his Instagram all of the various examples of—
TRUMP: Too many.
ROGAN:—troops that are deployed, thousands and thousands of troops that are currently deployed.
TRUMP: Stupidly deployed.
ROGAN: But the point is, if this is gonna be an actual real debate and not a propaganda exercise, if it's gonna be a real debate, you have to fact-check everybody. Like, if someone says maybe she thought there was no, which is also a problem. So it's one of two things. It's either it was not true. It was a lie on purpose, which is terrible. Or it was the opposite. It was ignorance, which is also terrible.
TRUMP: Well, Joe, when I said crime is soaring, he said, ""No, no crime has gone down."" I said, ""Where did you hear that one, crime has gone down?"" I mean, I'm debating with this guy, but I've had that.
ROGAN: Well, there was amended FBI statistics that came out after that, that showed that crime had gone up substantially.
TRUMP: And by the way, the statistics were fraud because when they put out the statistics, they didn't include some of the worst places. They didn't include some of the worst cities, some of the most deadly places.
ROGAN: Then there is also a problem—
TRUMP: But when the real numbers came out, I turned out to be right. But I haven't gotten—
ROGAN: You turn out to be right but then there's another problem. Unreported crime is way up because people have lost—Look, the morale that the police department has, in a lot of these cities what they've done is defund the police, bullshit. These, the morale of these poor cops, it's fucking horrible. It's the dumbest idea of all time.
TRUMP: So bad. So bad.
ROGAN: But what they've done is they've, they've made these cops feel terrible, like good cops. I think cops are just like everybody else. Most of them are great. It's like everybody else. But if you run into one carpenter and he does a shitty job in your house, you say ""Carpenters fucking suck."" But they don't suck. Most of them are great.
TRUMP: Police have been—
ROGAN: And that's the key thing with cops. But the point is they, they did all of these things in this very foolish way. And these cops are suffering the consequences of it. And so subsequently, what happens is a lot of crime is unreported. A lot of crime, like you call the cops. They're too busy. They can't even get to you. ""Oh, your house got broken into. Sorry."" You know, it, it doesn't even make a report. There's a lot of people that they just give up.
TRUMP: It's so sad what's happened. And I'll tell you what. I go to police funerals. And we went to one in Long Island. I visited the family in Long Island. A very big deal. It's so dangerous. People don't realize—the car, dark windows, pull over. He's a gentleman. ""Please pull over."" Door opens. Guy comes out firing. Even if they were allowed to pull out their gun, which they're not, they can't pull out the—
ROGAN: Doing time, yeah.
TRUMP: They still wouldn't have time.
ROGAN: It's every cop's first nightmare.
TRUMP: They open a door and he was killed and his partner was hurt. He was killed. And you don't, I mean, you don't even have an eighth of a second to think. And it is such a dangerous job. That in particular, think of it. You go up to a car. You don't know who's sitting there with a gun. And if they have a gun, you really don't have a chance. You're not allowed to have your gun out, by the way. There're very strict rules.
So, number one, they're in it. But even if you could have your gun out, the door opens and a guy and bullets start firing out, and especially where they have the dark windows, darkened windows. It is such a dangerous profession. And it's very hard to get cops now because they're not given any backup. And you're right. You know, they have like an eighth of a second to make a decision that's gonna change their life. If they make the wrong decision, they're gonna end up on the front page of every newspaper in the country and they're gonna lose their house and their pension and their job and their wife is gonna be gone and everything is gonna be gone.
ROGAN: Absolutely. And here's another thing that people don't talk about. How many of them have PTSD? Probably most of them. These guys are seeing people shot all the time. You know, I've talked to a ton of cops about it and a lot of cops commit suicide. A lot of cops are deeply depressed. A lot of cops have seen—
TRUMP: But we have to give them back their dignity. We have to, we can't—we just have to give them back—You said it so good. You never hear anybody say that—You're never gonna have it perfect, you're gonna have a bad apple.
ROGAN: In everything, in every profession.
TRUMP: But every time there's a bad apple, that gets massive publicity and it, it taints everybody also.
ROGAN: But it's also this very irresponsible thing where people say defund the police, get rid of the police. Even Kamala Harris was a part of that, that it's a, it's a very stupid way to look at it. What you should do is fund the police. You should have better training. You should have cops that feel more appreciated. You should have some something that helps mitigate this PTSD that all of them suffer through.
TRUMP: Right. She was uh, a big part of defund the police. That was a big thing for her, defund the police, always defund the police.
ROGAN: Well, it's a political idea.
TRUMP: Yeah. But anybody with that political thought, I don't think should be running for President. And I think people are getting wise to it. you know, We're doing pretty well now. I don't know. Maybe in a week from now, say sorry about that. I was wrong.
But we're leading everything. And I think we're gonna have a very good election. But I tell people—because people are starting to get to know her. But she was defund the police. She was all these trans-gender operations. If you wanted a sex change and you were in detention and you demanded a sex change, they would give you a sex change.
ROGAN: Well, the wildest one is this idea of giving free sex change to illegal immigrants.
TRUMP: That's right, in detention.
ROGAN: That is the wildest thing. Is that the biggest problem you have? You just walked here from Guatemala. You need to become a girl.
TRUMP: That's right. But she was in favor of it.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: So, so, think of it. Now she changed. She's changed 15 policies. In fact, I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap.
ROGAN: She stole your idea about no tax for tips.
TRUMP: I came up with this idea that honestly, nobody ever heard of. And now it took her two months. But you know what? All of us—
ROGAN: Well, it caught fire.
TRUMP: And she just put it into a little speech.
ROGAN: Yep, it became popular.
TRUMP: Well, I think we still have that issue. I think that issue is a good one for us. And then we have a lot of good issues. you know, We had the other day. Think of how simple some of these things are. We're trying to get cars built in the United States. Detroit has been really tough. It's been a disaster. They have a huge factory, a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico. Make cars, sell them in the United States, put everybody out of business. Here we go again.
I said, ""If that plant is there when I'm President, I will put 100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car."" They'll be unsellable in the United States. And they just announced they're not gonna build the plant because they think I'm gonna win. Think of it. They're not gonna build the plant. This was their biggest plant in the world. More than all of Michigan makes. That's how big. you know, This is what we're getting to. And I said, ""If that plan goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm gonna tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200 percent apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States."" They just announced they're not gonna build the plant.
ROGAN: Yeah, I read that.
TRUMP: And they did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, and I've said this for the last couple of weeks, in the dictionary today, and any, is the word tariff. It's more beautiful than love. It's more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs. It will keep—
ROGAN: Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?
TRUMP: Well, okay.
ROGAN: Were you serious about that?
TRUMP: Yeah, sure, why not? Because we—Ready? Our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s. A President who was assassinated named McKinley, he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful. uh, ""We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price.""
And the big price is tariffs. And he'd speak like that. But he was right. And then around, in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America. ""We don't want to pay tariffs. Please don't."" you know, Believe me. They control our politicians. If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make, then and now. But we had a commission meeting in the uh, I think it was 1887.
Think of this problem. We were so rich. We had so much money. We didn't know what to do. So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs. And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had. We were so rich because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our jobs. And China does it. That's what China did. If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory here or have a factory, they don't take our cars. They wouldn't take our cars. But if you build a plant in China, you can do that. Elon did that. By the way, Elon is great. That guy is such a great guy. I think you're a fan of Elon.
ROGAN: I love him.
TRUMP: He is from a different planet. He's the greatest guy. That rocket coming in. I'm, I'm, I told the story once or twice, so you may have heard it because his speeches have been good. Did you see the one last night?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: 29,000 people. That was it. And the one the night before was the same thing. We are, we are rocking and rolling. But Elon, and I'm talking to this very important guy, I said, ""Wait a minute, I'm looking at something."" The television's unmuted, right/
And I see this rocket. It's all brown from the heat, you know, 10,000 degrees pouring down at thousands of miles an hour. And I see this thing. you know, It's like a 20-story building.
ROGAN: And it catches it.
TRUMP: And I say to this guy, he's an important guy, ""Wait a minute. uh, Let me just put you to hold. I got to see this."" And I see this and, and it's gonna crash. I said, ""It's gonna crash into the gantry."" They call it a gantry. I said, ""Oh man, that's gonna be a disaster"" because it's starting to get very close. And then all of a sudden you see the flames in the bottom, rrrrr and then boom. And then you see the two arms grab it.
ROGAN: Crazy.
TRUMP: And I forgot the guy. I had him on the phone. I forgot. No, I said, ""The hell with it."" No, I called Elon. I said, ""Was that you?"" He said, ""That was me."" And I said, ""Who else can do that?"" He said, ""Nobody. Russia can't do it. The United States. Nobody can do it.""
You know, I set up Space Force. That was me. And that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another branch since the Air Force. And that's gonna be one of our most important things. But think of what Elon does. And he did one other thing that I never heard of it. It's uh, Starlink. I went down to North Carolina, Georgia, the different places, right?
I followed it right down. And they had no communication. The poles were all knocked down. Every—and one of the guys in North Carolina said, ""Could you do me a favor? Do you know Elon Musk?"" ""Yes. He endorsed me."" By the way, he gave me the nicest endorsement, to the tough—he said, ""The country is gonna fail and you should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala."" Kamala. You're not a Kamala person. I know you. I've watched you. I know him better than he is. You know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife. I have watched you for so many years. You're not a Kamala person. You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person. Nobody's gonna know who Khabib is. [Khabib Nurmagomedov, mixed martial arts fighter]
ROGAN: They know who Khabib is.
TRUMP: But he was not bad, right?
ROGAN: Oh, he was phenomenal.
TRUMP: But that's your kind of person.
ROGAN: Your weave is getting wide. We're getting wide with this weave.
TRUMP: No, no. My weave but is it much better?
ROGAN: I want to bring it back to tariffs.
TRUMP: But wait. One second. Before we finish with tariffs. So they said, they said, ""Could you get him? We need Starlink."" And I called Elon. He got it for him so fast, saved so many lives. And I said, ""How was it?"" They said, ""Better than the wires."" You know, they couldn't put them in. They were all gone. So getting back to tariffs.
ROGAN: I've used it recently in Utah in the mountains.
TRUMP: That's great. Did you find it good?
ROGAN: Oh, it's phenomenal. It's the size of an iPad. You just set it down on the ground, you get high speed internet. It's incredible.
TRUMP: We're spending—Just to show you. We're spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right? Up to upstate areas where you have, like, two farms and they're spending millions of dollars to advocate. Elon can do it for nothing.
ROGAN: Well, talk about the $42 billion that was wasted on this internet access program. That the United States—they didn't get anybody access to internet.
TRUMP: They haven't hooked up one person yet.
ROGAN: Not one person.
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: They spent $42 billion. They could have gotten Starlinks to everybody with that kind of money.
TRUMP: For almost nothing.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: For a monthly charge.
ROGAN: And it would have been incredible. And it's high speed internet everywhere you want to go.
TRUMP: And he wanted to do that.
ROGAN: And he wanted to do it.
TRUMP: How about this? They built uh, the charger stations, right? In the Midwist—in the Midwest. They built eight of them. They cost $9 billion. That's like a gas pump, right? They built nine gas pumps, except electricity comes out. They spent $9 billion. Three of them don't work. The whole thing. There's so much waste. I could, I could sit here and tell you about things that, that there's so much waste, abuse, and fraud.
ROGAN: Oh! Yeah. I'm sure. I mean, I think everybody's aware of that now.
TRUMP: Likes get back to tariffs.
ROGAN: When you're talking about—One of the criticisms of your Administration was with tax cuts and with tariffs, you increased the deficit.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: So was—what was the strategy behind that? And did you think it was gonna increase the deficit by a substantial amount?
TRUMP: Okay. We were ready to rock. It was all—You know, I had a bad system. We had horrible tax policy. I made it great. With a much lower tax rate. So I took it from almost 40% down to 21%. Now I'm bringing it from 21% down to 15%. But only if you make your product in the United States, which is great. People call me. They said, ""What a great idea."" Nobody ever heard of that before. I don't care if they make the product in Japan. Why should I give up? So it's a 21.
That—at 21, in the first year, we took in much more revenue than we did at almost 40. Think of that. It inspired—Now we had other things, too. We were able to get people to bring back their money. You couldn't—you couldn't bring back your money. If you had money in Europe, like Apple, Apple had many billions of dollars outside. They couldn't bring it. There was no way to bring it back in. uh, The bureaucracy, the documents, the whole thing. And also the tax was too high. They wanted like half of it or something.
Nobody's gonna do that. So they leave their money in Japan and they spend their money there. That was part of what I did. The money came pouring back in. Apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They brought it back from overseas. They brought it in.
ROGAN: So how does the deficit increase because of that?
TRUMP: So what happened is this. We were ready to rock and roll. And then we had the COVID thing and we had to focus on that. And if we didn't give some businesses a hand, they would have all—you would have had a depression like in 1929. But we were ready to start. We were going to—we would have very shortly been paying off debt.
You know, we have $35 trillion in debt. And I'll never forget it. We were—it was talking about from, you know, the standpoint of being in office. I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio, the two very good pollsters probably. I don't know. I would say the two best. Who knows? But very good pollsters. And we're starting to think about running for a second term. And we had the greatest economy in history. Never has there been an economy like that.
ROGAN: And you attribute that to lowering taxes and tariffs.
TRUMP: Yeah. A lot of—Two things. And also, I cut regulations more than anybody else. And if—I asked many of the businessmen, you know, from the big companies, you know, the guys running the big companies, I'd say, ""So if you had your choice, you've had it now for a long time. What's more important to you? The tax cuts, you paid less tax, or the regulation cuts?"" Every one of them said the regulation cuts meant more.
Who would think that? Right? Because you don't equate it to dollars, but it actually is more dollars. uh, We had it going and then we just hadta focus on something else. But they were sitting—
ROGAN: So you think—
TRUMP: These two pollsters were sitting there and they said, ""Sir, if George Washington came back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP, as opposed to Walz,"" how bad is he, by the way? But if Abraham Lincoln was his VP, they couldn't beat you. You have a—and I'll never forget it. The following day, they said, ""Something's happening in China, sir. Could we meet?"" I said, ""What's happening?"" ""People are dying."" And it was all around the Wuhan lab, by the way. There are pictures with little lines, they're body bags, all around the Wuhan lab. And I always said that from the beginning, Joe, was, you know, they tried to say, first they said it was France and you know, they blamed everybody.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: But then they say it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away. So we got hit with that. And despite that, we had the best economy. And when I gave it over, the stock market was higher than it was pre-COVID. I mean, nobody could even believe it. But we saved it. And we were helping businesses. They were dying. You know, they were dying.
ROGAN: So it's your belief that if you had a second term, given the policies in place, the way the economy was booming, that you would have been able to pay off a lot of the debt. And that was the strategy.
TRUMP: If we didn't have COVID, we would have been paying off debt. And we would have had—and don't forget, by growth, the word growth is actually more important in a way, because you could have the same debt. But if you doubled your growth, all of a sudden you're under levered. But still, we should pay off debt. You know, if you viewed this uh, $35 trillion right now, it's a lot.
But if you look at the asset value, if you looked at it purely as an asset value, we have oil underground, we have water, we have mountains, we have—I mean, the assets are so enormous. But regardless of that, we've got $35 trillion in debt, we should pay it off. And we would've started paying off debt and probably even giving further, given further tax reductions.
I want to get it down to 15%. We're gonna do more business. But when you get hit with a COVID, everything stops, and you have to keep these businesses alive. The businesses were dying. I mean, they were just dying. This whole place, this country was gonna die.
ROGAN: Are there influences uh, outside of environmental that keep people from wanting to drill for oil and frack and do those sorts of things? Outside of the environmental concerns, which are legitimate, of course.
TRUMP: Yeah, no.
ROGAN: But are there other influences that maybe over-accentuate or over-exaggerate these environmental effects? Are, are people being influenced in a way where they're trying to keep us from producing American oil?
TRUMP: Yeah. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah?
TRUMP: So the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth, the biggest tool. The other is regulation. And if you speak to Elon, he said the regulation now to send a rocket up to anywhere, even if you do everything, it's almost, it's becoming impossible. But they use environmental in order to get people not to do anything. And sometimes I say, you know, I look at some of the, I know the environmental stuff better because I had to build buildings in New York.
I had to build, I had to do environmental impact studies. And I would see some of these guys that I'd hire for a lot of money, environmentalists that would get you through the process. And they'd be up in Albany, that's the capital of New York, and they're up there trying to make it tougher for guys like me that were builders because they'd get paid more money. In other words, I, I had one guy, uh, highly recommended, all, you know, I was good at getting permits. I was one of the kings of, I was always very good. But the environmental stuff was always horrible. They could slow a project down 10 years, 15 years. I had a project in Louisiana, built—big LNG plant. It was, uh, for 14 years, it was gonna cost $18 million—$18 billion, one of the biggest, like the Empire State Building, laying down on its side, times four, massive, on the coast, on the Gulf Coast. And they said, ""Sir, they're gonna give it up."" I said, ""They shouldn't give it up. What's the problem?"".
""They can't get their environmental."" They had environmental permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling. And they said there was one mistake on one little line, they wanted 'em do it all over again. I said, ""It's not gonna happen."" And I got them their permit instantly. And they built the plant, it's massive.
ROGAN: So when you're saying that—
TRUMP: The weapon.
ROGAN: So there's people that are making money by making it difficult. Are you talking about lawyers? Because they're dragging out—
TRUMP: No, I'm talking about environmental—
ROGAN: the process?
TRUMP:—consultants and lawyers.
ROGAN: Environmental consultants, profit off of dragging out the process.
TRUMP: Absolutely.
ROGAN: And how do they profit?
TRUMP: They make the process worst.
ROGAN: How do they profit off of it?
TRUMP: And I'd probably do the same thing if I were them, to be honest with you, you know?
ROGAN: That's business, men.
TRUMP: I want to be honest with you.
ROGAN: How do they do that? How do they make it?
TRUMP: They go, let's say New York, they go to Albany.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: And they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant on the ground that's this big, and in theory valueless, that it's a rare plant, and you cannot ever—even touch it, you can't go near it, you can't put a building on it, you can't do anything. Or there's a little puddle, and they call it a lake, and you have to go by the standards of a lake. I said, ""No, no, that's a puddle."" Oh, you have no idea. Guys are filling a little puddle. You have no idea what they do. And they use it as a way to stop you.
ROGAN: They use it as a way to stop you and also as a way to generate money.
TRUMP: It's a weapon.
ROGAN: I'm curious at how are they generating money that way, though?
TRUMP: Well, they get fees.
ROGAN: They get fees?
TRUMP: Massive fees. And you pay these guys.
ROGAN: And people rely on them as experts, because they're the people that they go to when they have to run these studies in the first place?
TRUMP: Yeah, but some of them are just bad guys, and they're trying to make it more and more difficult.
ROGAN: And they have a lot of power?
TRUMP: Yeah, ah, I, I think they maybe had more. They didn't have as much with me, because I would get through them, and I understood it. Look, I've had, I've done so many, they call it environmental impact study. I did so much. To build a building. To build a building in New York is very tough. You've got to deal with, think of it, financing, unions, uh, all the municipal stuff, environmental. Of all of it, to me, the toughest thing was the environmental, because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff. And, and you hire a so-called expert, and they say, ""Sir, he's the one guy who can get you through the morass."" It's a morass. It's horrible. They use it as a weapon. They use it all over the country.
ROGAN: Right. But there are legitimate concerns about environmental impact, correct?
TRUMP: There are. There are but.
ROGAN: Like, look about the BP oil spill.
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: There's a lot of things that do happen that are environmentally devastating.
TRUMP: Sure, yeah.
ROGAN: And you want to mitigate that as much as possible.
TRUMP: You do. You do. Look, I had—during our four years, we had the cleanest air and the cleanest water. I view it differently. I say air and water. Remember this. It costs much more to do things environmentally clean. China doesn't do anything.
ROGAN: Right.
When Kerry goes to see uh, President Xi at China, which he probably doesn't even get to see him, but they look at him, ""Oh, yes, yes, we will do, oh, yes, yes, we're gonna do that. No more coal, no more coal. Just—"" And then they approve 58 coal plants for the next, you know, every, they build a coal plant a week, okay.
ROGAN: They built a lot of coal plants. We've covered that.
TRUMP: But let me just tell you, though, so here we are cleaning and scrubbing everything and everything's got to—and the air's got to be pure. But in 3.8 days, that stuff floating over China is right over the top of us.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Same thing with the oceans. They dump their garbage into the Pacific Ocean. If you take a little cork and put it there, in about a week and a half, it'll be in front of Los Angeles. We're picking up their garbage. So, nobody ever talks about that. But in a way, the bigger one is even—the air. It's the currents. It's an amazing thing. It's been flowing that way for a million years, long before we were there.
ROGAN: We share air with the whole world. Yeah.
TRUMP: No. If we're cleaning—
ROGAN: We get the Sahara dust clouds over here.
TRUMP: Absolutely.
ROGAN: We get dust clouds in Austin from the Sahara Desert.
TRUMP: But we get the China, uh, you know, they call it the China curse. We get the China curse, they're bad, and their air is dirty. You know, when I went there, uh, I had a great relationship with President Xi. We got along very well. And they treated me better than anybody's ever been treated. Same thing with Saudi Arabia, a number of them. But they laid it out. And I said, ""This air is good."" Do you know, they closed every factory one week before I got there, from within 200 miles.
ROGAN: That's like what Gavin Newsom did when Xi Jinping came to San Francisco.
TRUMP: He cleaned it up.
ROGAN: He cleaned it up. He got rid of all the homeless people.
TRUMP: Isn't that terrible in a way? To think, you know, he cleaned it up, and then it became a pigsty.
ROGAN: Well, the dumbest thing is, he said, ""When your friends come by, when you have visitors, you clean up your house."" Like, how about just keep your fucking house clean?
TRUMP: Can you imagine?
ROGAN: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard anybody say, ever, as a Governor, as to excuse to why you finally cleaned up your homeless problem.
TRUMP: And the day he left.
ROGAN: Right back to it.
TRUMP: It went right back.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But in a way, that was a bad thing that he did. Because he showed—
ROGAN: He showed it could be done.
TRUMP: What a disgrace that was. What a disgrace.
ROGAN: Well, this is the thing that, like, shows you how foolish a lot of these people that are running these cities think, and a lot of these people that are running these states think. It's foolish. like You're insulting the intelligence of the people that live in that city that are impacted by these people just camping, and needles, and human feces. There's uh, an app that you can buy. There's an app that you can get, rather, that will show you where the human feces has been documented in San Francisco.
It's a poo app. And it's just everywhere. It's just bum crap. Everywhere.
TRUMP: But let me give you one that you may not know, which I think you know everything, actually.
ROGAN: That's not true.
TRUMP: As a student of yours. But water. you know, In—
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP:—Los Angeles, you can't get proper amounts of water and it's unbelievably expensive, and you might have a house in Beverly Hills, and they're actually thinking about rationing water. Can you believe it?
ROGAN: I could believe it. I used to live there.
TRUMP: I was, I was in the farm country with some of the congressmen. We're driving up a highway and I say, ""How come all this land is so barren?"" It's farmland and it looked terrible. It was just brown and bad. I said, ""But there's always that little corner that's so green and beautiful."" They said, ""We have no water."" I said, ""Do you have a drought?"" ""No, we don't have a drought."" I said, ""Why don't you have no water?"" Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. It's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north of water, more water than they could ever use. And in order to protect a tiny little fish, the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured.
You gotta see this. We're driving up and I had never seen it before. It's the most—it's like Iowa. It's the most fertile land. Iowa's blessed with great land. Idaho for a potato, right?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But, they're just—by the way, some land is good for a potato. Some land is good for corn. It's the craziest thing. I love the farmers. They're great. They're the greatest. And by the way, they're getting killed right now.
ROGAN: They are.
TRUMP: They're getting killed because of this stupid Administration. But, so I see this and I said, ""You got to be kidding."" I said, ""You mean you have water?"" And I looked at it, it's like a valve in your sink, except it's massive. The thing's five times taller than your ceiling.
ROGAN: Did you know the center of California was a giant lake?
TRUMP: They have so much water.
ROGAN: You ever see what it looks like before they rerouted it?
TRUMP: No, I never saw that. No.
ROGAN: The center of California, what is it, 200 years ago? How long ago did they do that, Jamie?
JAMIE One second.
ROGAN: The center of California had a fucking enormous lake in the middle of California.
TRUMP: So they dumped it into the Pacific.
ROGAN: Who knows what they did. But whatever foolishness that they did led to the situation they're in now.
TRUMP: Think of those dry forests that burned down all over. You know, the head of Austria said—
ROGAN: Here it is. Tulare Lake or Tache Lake. It's a freshwater lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley, United States. Historically, Tulare Lake was one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi. Show a photo of what it looked like back then.
TRUMP: That's a great system.
ROGAN: So that's what it looked like. Look at that image. Now the one—Go to the one on the third from the right.
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah. That was an enormous lake in the middle of California.
TRUMP: What a beautiful thing.
ROGAN: Imagine that.
TRUMP: That'd be much more valuable property.
ROGAN: How crazy is that? But how crazy is that's what it used to look like and human beings screwed that up.
TRUMP: No, they let it go into the Pacific and then they did something.
ROGAN: I don't know what they did. What did they do? How did it go missing?
TRUMP: Wow.
JAMIE They said they drained it in '83.
TRUMP: Yeah, they drained it.
ROGAN: 1983. Oh my God.
JAMIE It went dry a handful of times.
ROGAN: Oh, it went dry a handful of times. Well, lakes do go dry, but that's a big one.
TRUMP: But think of it—
ROGAN: That's a big one to go dry.
TRUMP: You could have all of the water you need, all of that land would have more water. The whole thing could be like that little patch. Literally, literally I'd say—I was with Devin Nunes, a congressman and other congressmen, we were going up. I was visiting them because they asked me to go up and visit their territory and I did. But I kept saying, ""Look at this land. It's beautiful, but it's so dry."" And I thought they were going through like a desert like a drought. They said, ""No, we have water, but it gets—"" So I looked into it.
ROGAN: What is the fish?
TRUMP: And I got it done. I got it done. I could have water for all of that land, water for your forests. you know, Your forests are dry as a bone, okay?
ROGAN: Yeah. Dangerous.
TRUMP: That water could be routed. you know, You could have everything. Not only dangerous, billions of dollars a year they spend on forest fires. And you know, there's a case with the environment. They're not allowed to rake their forests because you're not allowed to touch it. When a tree falls down, after 18 months it becomes very dry. It's like you know, real firewood. It's bad.
A tree that's up, these are all things I learned the hard way, the easy way. But when a tree is up, it sucks water. It's wet. I went to, that, they had a couple of horrible forest fires in California and I went. I said, ""You got a lot of trees standing."" ""They were healthy trees, sir."" I said, with this intense heat that you could see they were charred a little bit on the bottom, but they were gonna be all right because they're soaking wet because they suck up the water, right?
But when they fall, they're like—it's like lighting a match and you got to be able to clean. They call maintain your forest. So I was with the head of Austria. He said, ""You know what? It's a shame. I see all those forest fires in California and all they have to do is clean their forest,"" meaning rake it up, get rid of the leaves, you know, get rid of leaves that are sitting there for five years and—
ROGAN: Well certainly get rid of the dead fall.
TRUMP: And get rid of the trees that have fallen that are like —So many things, this country, by the way, I had it all—
ROGAN: Could you really rake the whole forest though? I don't think you could rake the whole forest. I think you can get rid of the dead fall, but raking all the leaves—
TRUMP: You could certainly get rid of the dead, okay?
ROGAN: Yeah, I think that's the real issue is the dead fall.
TRUMP: Environmentally, they don't want to do that. They said no no, it's got to be nature and all this stuff. But in the meantime, this is exactly—But you could have—So it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals, but Gavin Newsom had to sign them. I got it all done. Nobody could believe it. It was all done. I said, ""I got it."" You got so much water. All you have to do is sign. And that guy didn't wanna sign.
ROGAN: Did he not want to sign because that would be a political victory for you?
TRUMP: I think, no, he didn't. No, I don't think so. He used to say he's a great President, and we got along. We did. We actually got along at that point. But I think somebody said, "" uh, You just can't continue to call him a great President."" you know, They do say that. But we had it all done. He didn't sign. And then we got onto other things. And I said—every time I go to California, I said, ""You have so much water."" They don't know it. I'm telling you, people living in Beverly Hills, they turn off their water. Same thing with the electric. They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend you know.
ROGAN: Well, right after they made the announcement that as of 2035, you're not gonna be able to buy an internal combustion engine in California. like Within a month they had some announcement asking people to not charge their Tesla's because the grid couldn't handle it. Well, how are you gonna handle—
TRUMP: I'll terminate the mandate immediately, this mandate.
ROGAN: Good. Thank you.
TRUMP: That will be done, I would say in my first day, maybe two days, because it's a little bit busy.
ROGAN: Let me ask you about nuclear. One, one of the things that when I've talked to people that have a real understanding of nuclear power, they, what their position is, it's probably the cleanest, safest form of electricity that we could generate and that the fears of nuclear power are really about a few disasters. The Fukushima, Three Mile Island, uh, these are old systems and they—they're much more capable now and they're capable of making even better systems. But it's a difficult political issue because you think nuclear power, you think Chernobyl, that's what everybody does. They have this connection in their heads that the potential—
TRUMP: Or Fukushima where you're not supposed to enter the land for 3,000 years or something. It's crazy.
ROGAN: I think it's worse than that. I think that area is like gonna be radioactive for probably longer than you could imagine. But, the, the point is they're better at it now and that they could do it now. And you can generate power in a way that you don't have to worry about these—one of the most ridiculous things is electric cars being powered by coal- fired plants. It's a ridiculous thing.
TRUMP: It's what's happening.
ROGAN: Yeah, it is what's happening.
TRUMP: That's what's happening.
ROGAN: And people want to think they're being green, but it's—
TRUMP: Well, if you look at the way the battery is made. But here's the other thing. We don't have—well, we do actually. It's being held. We have certain areas where we have great raw earth material and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment. And we have areas in California that have incredible raw earth and they're not allowing, and I'm gonna open it up. I'm gonna let 'em use it. China—
ROGAN: But how do you do that and protect the environment?
TRUMP: Because the environment's gonna be protected. You can do it. You can make a lake out of it, okay? We'll put back a lake. I mean, something nice about lakes. You can do things magnificently—
ROGAN: You just have to do it carefully and responsibly.
TRUMP: Absolutely. You have to do it carefully. But the problem, you know, China has all of those areas, most of those areas, and yet when they say go electric with the cars, China's gonna be the one that gives us the cars. All of those guys in Detroit are gonna be out of business. You're gonna make your electric cars over there.
We have a thing called gasoline, and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other nation. you know, I had in Alaska, there's a find, it's called ANWR. I got it approved. Reagan couldn't get it. Nobody could get it. I got it all done. It was amazing. They were getting ready to start drilling, the equivalent, they think, of Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest finds in the world. It was all set to go and Biden comes in, his, one of his first orders were, we're not gonna use it. It would've been so good for the—We could have supplied all of Asia with oil and gas.
ROGAN: What was the negative about it?
TRUMP: And you talk about money—
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: The negative was politically, they didn't think it was good for them. That's all.
ROGAN: That's all it was. So you don't think that it's environmentally dangerous?
TRUMP: No. Taking it from way down deep in the earth. Environmentally would've been fine.
ROGAN: So it can be done responsibly?
TRUMP: Absolutely. Or otherwise—
ROGAN: To the point where it protects the environment.
TRUMP: Well, I think windmills—Okay, so they talk about windmills.
ROGAN: It's a good point.
TRUMP: I think windmills are really disruptive. When you talk about the environment, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill someday that hasn't been cleaned out with all the bird carcasses. You, it's like massive amounts of birds.
ROGAN: They're also a massive eyesore.
TRUMP: Oh, they're horrible.
ROGAN: I went to a ranch in south Texas. We had to drive past this enormous windmill farm, and it's gross. It's dystopian. You're looking in the left and the right and all you see is these big spinning machines that aren't even that effective at generating electricity.
TRUMP: Correct. Most expensive form of electricity is a windmill, and then they start to rust and rot.
ROGAN: And you have to replace them.
TRUMP: And then they get abandoned by the people that built them because—
ROGAN: Well, you have to get rid of all that material too. When you replace those blades, now you have a problem because you have to dispose.
TRUMP: You can't bury them.
ROGAN: Right. You have to dispose these enormous windmills. And how do you dispose of them?
TRUMP: By the way, they say you can't bury them. So, I even questioned that, but I'm not gonna get into it. But they say you can't bury them. So you have the blades and you can't bury the blades. You can bury the blades. It's not gonna matter. You can bury. You'll find areas you can bury. But they come up, this is what I mean, they come up with this, but the environmentalist dream is windmills everywhere. You know what happens to them? After five years, they start to rot. After 10 years, you have to replace them. Did you ever look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills and they've been abandoned and they're all different manufacturers and all different companies and they all—
ROGAN: I haven't seen that.
TRUMP: It is the ugliest thing. It looks like a graveyard almost, a graveyard of windmills.
ROGAN: It's pollution.
TRUMP: It's so bad. And the oceans—
ROGAN: It's no different than leaving garbage on the ground.
TRUMP: How about in New Jersey? Off the coast of New Jersey, they wanna build, the people are going crazy not to build them. But where you have them, the whales are washing up on shore. So in 50 years they had one whale come ashore. Now they had like 18 come in the last year.
ROGAN: What is happening with the whales? I've read about this.
TRUMP: Well, they say that the wind drives them crazy. It's a vibration because you have those—those things are 50 story buildings some of them. Fifty!
ROGAN: Right. And they're super sensitive to vibrations and sounds.
TRUMP: The wind is rushing, the things are blowing. It's a vibration and it makes noise. You know what it is? I want to be a whale psychiatrist. It drives the whales frickin' crazy and something happens with them. But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up on shore. And yet the environmentalists—
ROGAN: Conveniently ignored by the environmental people.
TRUMP: But the environmentalists, they don't talk about it. I think there's nothing uglier. I see it Scotland. I see it all over the world. You have this beautiful valley. It's been there for, in civilization, thousands of years, but millions of years, and all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up.
ROGAN: Would your plan to be replace that with nuclear? What would you do?
TRUMP: Well, nuclear is better. I, I think there's a little danger, nuclear, but we had some really bad nuclear. They did one in Alabama. They did one in, I think, South Carolina. They do them wrong. They build these massive things. Then the environmentalists get in—I don't want to go into a long story because it's too long for the show. This show is too valuable to talk about concrete, but they have hardened concrete. It's number 12 concrete. It's the hardest. It's harder than steel. It's incredible. They put up a wall and an inspector comes along those—""Nope, nope. You're a quarter of an inch too—"" The wall might be eight feet wide. You're a quarter of an inch too short. I'm sorry. You got to rip down the wall. You got to—Because it's got to be poured contiguously. You're one quarter of an inch—I'm sorry, rip down. You can't rip it down. This stuff, you can't put a hammer through it. It's incredible. Concrete technology is unbelievable what's you know, what's happened. You think of concrete—
ROGAN: So you think that's an example of over-regulation, pointless over-regulation?
TRUMP: Well, you have an inspector that comes along and he says, ""Take down a 25 zillion dollar wall."" These things ended up costing 25 billion dollars. And they, one of them never got opened. But here's the story. So—France does it. France is largely nuclear, and they build small little compact plants, and if they need more, they build the same thing and they hook it up and they hook it up because they get too big and too complex and too expensive. And it is very clean. They say it's it's absolutely—you know, My uncle, I had a great uncle who was a great genius, just like other members of my family, but he was a professor at MIT for I think 41 years. He was the longest—When I was in the White House, the head of MIT, Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me, and the MIT person said, ""I have a book on your uncle Dr. John Trump. He was our longest serving professor. He was a great genius, sir. Do you know how—""
And uh, he knew everything about nuclear. From math to chemistry to nuclear, he knew it. And he said, ""Someday it's got to be the way to go."" But the problem is it's so dangerous in terms of war. He said, ""Donald, someday,""—this was a long time, Uncle John, Dr. John Trump, he said, ""Someday you'll have a little satchel at your side and you'll go into a building and you'll be able to blow up New York City."" I said, ""Uncle John, that'll never happen."" He's right. you know, He's right.
ROGAN: Well, that was part of the problem—
TRUMP: The power is so great.
ROGAN:—with giving nuclear power to other countries, right? That was the problem that happened with India and Pakistan. They got nuclear power and then they were able to weaponize it.
TRUMP: The biggest problem in the world today is not global warming. It's nuclear warming. And we have idiots that are negotiating for us. We have a guy that doesn't make it past four o'clock, and it's not because of age. you know, I know so many guys in their late 80s, and they're better than—I said to one guy the other day, ""I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago."" I've known him a long time. He's 89 years old. He's sharp as—I mean, he's great. Biden gives people a bad name because that's not an old—that's not an age. I think they say it because I'm three or four years younger. you know, I think that's why they say it. They say his age. It's not his age. He's got a problem.
ROGAN: Had two major brain surgeries.
TRUMP: Operations, yeah. He did. He did. Those are not good operations.
ROGAN: And did you see what he did today? He went running towards the camera and made some apology to Nav—Native Americans, and uh, he said that's why he is headed out west. like He's off the reservation, so to speak, for lack of a better term.
TRUMP: It's interesting because during the debate, I was uh, looking over him saying, ""This is strange."" Sort of strange things were happening.
ROGAN: Yeah. Well, he couldn't keep it together. But do you think they knew he couldn't keep it together?
TRUMP: I think so.
ROGAN: Do you think that they wanted—Is that why, like historically, that debate was earlier than they've been in the past, right?
TRUMP: I think they wanted to get—Well, there's a lot of theories. A lot of people said, do the debate now and we'll get him out.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I think that maybe could be.
ROGAN: Well, that is what happened. So it's logical to assume that's the one.
TRUMP: It is what happened. I think they also said do the debate now and get it over with.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: I don't think anybody thought he was gonna get out, really.
ROGAN: It didn't make any sense.
TRUMP: The debate got him out, but I think it's very unfair. Look, you have a bad debate, his numbers went down, but I think she's not doing very well right now, and I think she looks—
ROGAN: Well, I want to get to that too, because it's hard to know. like The whole poll thing is very bizarre for most people because most people don't answer polls. So they read the polls, then like, who's getting polled? I've never been polled. If I did, I'd hang up.
TRUMP: I was never called by a pollster.
ROGAN: If I did, I wouldn't answer. I'm busy.
TRUMP: You know how polls are done? Oh, I'm gonna get myself in trouble.
ROGAN: Please.
TRUMP: So I really don't believe too much in 'em.
ROGAN: Well, 2016 taught a lot of people about the ineffective use of polls.
TRUMP: Well, they were very ineffective because I thought I was doing well. I'd go to a place and I'd have 30, 40,000 people. Hillary would go, they have 500 people. And they tell me I'm gonna lose. I said, ""Why am I gonna lose?"" I had 40,000 people. She had 200 people. But you know, I have a theory, these pollsters, they charge you a lot of money too. you know, They charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll and they interview like 251 people. I don't think they interview them in many cases. I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.
ROGAN: Do you think it's bullshit?
TRUMP: No. I think they sit there, they make a deal, they get a half a million bucks, and they say, ""Trump's leading 51 to 49."" They announce it and everybody says, ""Oh, oh."" Do you understand?
ROGAN: Yeah. So you think—
TRUMP: I think in a lot—Look, I'm a very common sense person. I think that they probably don't always poll. Some of them probably never poll. uh, What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half?
ROGAN: Well, it's also a tiny percentage of the population. I don't think it's representative of the overall population. I just don't think it is.
TRUMP: I don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.
ROGAN: Exactly. That's my point. So, here, here's my question—
TRUMP: But I shouldn't say that because I'm doing very, you know, really well in the polls.
ROGAN: But I think that's—
TRUMP: So this week I happen to believe in the numbers. I only believe them if they're good. No, I like them this month. But no, I honestly believe that there's probably a lot of fraud. I had a poll, Washington Post, ABC in the Hillary thing, on Wisconsin. They had me down 17 points the day before the election. I knew it was wrong because I had a rally, I had 29,000 people at a racetrack, and it was like zero degrees, Wisconsin, and they had me down 17 points. In other words, you had no chance. And I won.
And I called up my pollster, good guy, good guy. And I believe he's legitimate. And you know, some of them are, and some of them are. I said, ""Tell me, why did they have me down so much?"" I mean, nobody's gonna believe them the next time. They said they don't care. When you're down 17 points, people are gonna stay home. They're not gonna vote because they're gonna say, ""I love Trump, but I'm not gonna waste my time. It's cold out."" I said, ""But what if they make it four or five?"" He said, ""At four or five, they're gonna go and vote. At 17, they're not gonna go and vote."" But think of it, this is the Washington Post, ABC poll. I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won. It's crooked stuff.
ROGAN: There's a lot of crooked stuff, and I wanted to talk about that too, because one of the things that people uh, talk about with you is uh, the denial of the results. And I think JD Vance did a brilliant job the other day when he was being interviewed uh, and they asked him, ""Did Trump lose the 2020 election?"" And he turned it around and said, ""Was there legitimate election interference in suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story on social media and was that a concerted effort?""
TRUMP: Well, they say it made 10 point difference, and I lost by one, one tenth of a point. They say it was 22,000 votes. But look, it was much more than that. And I appreciate JD Vance saying that. And by the way, I think he was a great pick. Do you like JD?
ROGAN: I like him a lot. Yeah.
TRUMP: You're allowed to say that.
ROGAN: No, I do. I like him a lot.
TRUMP: No, I think he's good.
ROGAN: I think he's a brilliant guy and I think his ability to talk like a normal human being—You did my friend Theo Von's podcast and he [Vance] just did it.
TRUMP: How did he do with it?
ROGAN: He did great. He just talks like a normal human being.
TRUMP: Is that why you called me to do this?
ROGAN: No, no.
TRUMP: I'm only kidding. He was a nice guy.
ROGAN: Once they shot you, I was like, ""He's got to come in here."" It's all about timing. It's all about the timing.
TRUMP: Timing is good.
ROGAN: Timing's perfect. Do you have even have a scar on your ear? You got anything on there?
TRUMP: I do.
ROGAN: Let me see. Let me see what you've got there.
TRUMP: So right over here—
ROGAN: It's a tiny little mark.
TRUMP: It zicked right there.
ROGAN: It healed up pretty fucking good.
TRUMP: Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little—it's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters.
ROGAN: No, you didn't cauliflower ear.
TRUMP: No, no. It got me, was sort of like a top shot. The point of the bullet was [inaudible], but you see the things take it off a little bit, but uh, it makes me a tougher guy. you know, The fighters, the fighters love their—You know Bo Nickal [mixed martial arts fighter]? He is a great fighter.
ROGAN: Yeah, I love Bo Nickals.
TRUMP: How's he gonna do? I think he's terrific.
ROGAN: He's great. He's a fantastic fighter.
TRUMP: He was almost undefeated in college.
ROGAN: Yeah, he's a fantastic wrestler and one of the best mixed martial artists.
TRUMP: When is he fighting again? I want to—
ROGAN: He's fighting in Madison Square Garden in November.
TRUMP: Oh, that's gonna be interes—after the election.
ROGAN: Yep.
TRUMP: So I'll either go as President or I'll be depressed and I won't bother going. I think they're having a fight right after.
ROGAN: One of the things that was fascinating also was the denial of the election results is, is a pretty common thing. Hillary Clinton famously denied that—She called you an illegitimate President and she said that Russia put you in place.
TRUMP: Even though she conceded.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: you know, She conceded the night of the election because she was beaten.
ROGAN: Yes. And it was a thing that was pretty common for people, especially Democrats, to deny the elections. uh, uh, There's been many of them. The Bush Administration, the you know, the dangling Chads, all that stuff.
TRUMP: Well, look at these guys in Congress. All these sleazebags in Congress that are Democrats, they're still denying 2016, but now they don't so much because you know, they try and pin it on me. You don't hear them say—
ROGAN: But here's my point.
TRUMP:—but they denied it right up until the end.
ROGAN: My point is this idea of election fraud is a forbidden topic, and you get labeled an election denier. It's like being labeled an anti-vaxer if you question some of the health consequences that people have had from the COVID-19 shots. ""Oh my God, you're anti—an anti-vaxer."" If you say, and what I say publicly, and I've said this a lot, it's not 0%. So if you ask me what is the amount of election fraud in this country? Is it 0%? No one thinks it's 0%. I've never met one person, not a, a, a super liberal, progressive, far-left person or a right-wing conservative, not one person thinks it's 0%. They think when you have human beings, and also you have a lot of weirdness that was going on during the 2020 elections, particularly with mail-in ballots.
TRUMP: And you had legislatures that had to approve and they didn't approve and they went out and did it anyway, and you had ballot—you had old-fashioned ballot screwing. I mean, you had people going up and dropping in phony votes. You had unsigned ballots, et cetera, et cetera.
ROGAN: There's certain people that think that they have—And the rhetoric is also that you're Hitler and that in order to stop Hitler, you have to do whatever it takes.
TRUMP: That was okay. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah. And you're hearing this now, Kamala compared you to—Said your love of Hitler yesterday.
TRUMP: you know, Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for President should take—they should give 'em tests. And it's not an age thing, it's not based—If you look back on history, '70s and '80s, your greatest—some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time, world history, they were in their 70s and their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody—they say it's unconstitutional, but I think—
ROGAN: That's ridiculous.
TRUMP: I think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her.
ROGAN: Well, I think it's pressure. I think the pressure and the scrutiny. You've been a celebrity for a long time and you understand what this is like, but for someone who's in her late 40s, who becomes the vice President, who runs for President, becomes the vice President, and then all of a sudden the weight of the world is on your shoulders and there's all these people paying attention. A lot of people clam up.
TRUMP: But you either have it or you don't.
ROGAN: Correct.
TRUMP: Look, this is an interview. You, we've covered a lot of territory right, and it's fine, I don't care. I want to. I think it's much more interesting. She, to do an interview with uh, Anderson Cooper, a softball, crazy softball interview. She took two days off and she studied and studied all day long and then she comes out with a result that was a real embarrassment. That was a really bad interview. She couldn't answer a question. And every question's not answered. I mean, like, ""What would you do your first day in office?"" Okay, I'll build a wall. I won't build a wall. There's a hundred things you can say. Just say anything. uh, There's something off with her.
ROGAN: Well, I also think—
TRUMP: Joe, we're dealing with the smartest people. They hate when I say—When the press, when I call President Xi, they said he called President Xi brilliant. Well, he's a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy whether you like it or not, and they go crazy and say, ""Oh—""
ROGAN: Right. It doesn't mean he's not evil or it doesn't mean he's not dangerous.
TRUMP: Yeah, of course not. But actually, we have evil people in our country.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: If you have a smart President, he can deal with Russia. He can deal with all of it. I had a, I had a—Russia would've never gone into Ukraine if I were President.
ROGAN: How would you have stopped it?
TRUMP: Automatic. Two things. I told him. I said, ""Vladimir, you're not going in."" I used to talk to him all the time. ""You're not going in."" I can't tell you what I told him because I think it would be inappropriate. But someday he'll tell you. But he would've never gone in. But you know why else he wouldn't have gone in? Oil prices at $40 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him, wouldn't have given him the money to prosecute that war. Wouldn't have given him the money.
I said it with President—I was with President Xi. I said—It was almost the same conversation. With Vladimir, it was Moscow. With President Xi, it was Beijing. It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, ""Don't do it."" He would've never done it.
The day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of Taiwan, 28 bombers. And it's the apple of his eye. And the same thing with Russia. It's the apple. Ukraine is the apple of his eye. I used to talk to him. I had a very good relationship with him. He wouldn't have done it. He would've never done it.
But he also wouldn't have done it because of the oil. You know, one of the reasons that what happened is, number one, he doesn't respect Biden at all. Not even a little bit. And who the hell would? But he doesn't respect him. But when he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled, number one, you take the soldiers out last, not first, okay? That was their big mistake. And we had that thing charted out and they weren't obeying us. They weren't—uh, Abdul is the head of the Taliban. Boom, boom, he had to do all these things. Some he didn't do. I said, ""Nope, you're not do—you gotta do them all.""
This guy, he immediately took all—He left the equipment behind. 13 soldiers dead. But he took everybody out. He took his soldiers out before. A child would know—that's where Milley was so stupid. He was such a stupid guy, Milley. Okay, those generals should have all been fired, the Afghan. The people that were involved with Afghanistan should have all been fired. Then they'd be writing books about him, how stupid he was and bad he was. But you take your soldiers out last.
I had a, a big rally and I saw a child in the front row uh, about a year and a half ago, and I called the child up. I said, ""Do you mind if I borrow your child?"" ""Oh, yes, please."" And they came up. Kids five years—I gave them quick details. I said, ""We want to get out of this place, and we have this, and we have this, and we have the equipment."" I gave him a little thing. I said, ""Do you take your soldiers out first or last after everything's done?"" ""You take them out last, sir."" A child would know that. We took our soldiers out first.
ROGAN: What was your plan—
TRUMP: And we left Bagram.
ROGAN: Well, not only that, we left billions of dollars worth of equipment and military vehicles that they use for parades now.
TRUMP: The best, the best equipment yet, to embarrass us, the best equipment in the world.
ROGAN: The Taliban parade where they got tanks rolling down the streets and Blackhawks flying is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
TRUMP: We left—
ROGAN: The fact that we left all that stuff there.
TRUMP:—the best equipment in the world behind.
ROGAN: What would you have done differently?
TRUMP: Well, number one, we would've taken it out. Just so you—Go back a little bit further. I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers with the sniper stuff. They were shooting, they were shooting a lot of them. They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me, but they were shooting 'em. And I said, ""Get this guy on the phone."" The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation with—It was a tough conversation.
Eighteen months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity because he shouldn't admit it. His people went nuts. He said, ""Yeah, well, I will admit no soldier—"" We didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan. Not one soldier was killed because he understood what was gonna happen if that happened. I didn't have one soldier.
So then when I left, after having gotten more votes than any sitting President in the history of the country, and much more votes than I got in 2016, when I left, they started shooting our soldiers. But more importantly, what they did is they did that whole thing with you know, leaving. He shouldn't have left. Number one, should have left from Bagram because Bagram's this massive base, it's got tremendous acreage around it, tremendous. It's a very big—It was built many years ago and part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China, one hour from where China makes its nuclear missiles. You should have never left Bagram, number one. They should have left from Bagram. They should have left last. They shoulda got—you know, we have Americans that are still there. They should have taken all their equipment out, everything, every plane, every screw should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, ""We're leaving, but I want to get everything out."" ""Sir, it's cheaper to leave it."" I said, ""What do you mean leave it?""
ROGAN: It's cheaper to leave it?
TRUMP: Yeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it. That was his—
ROGAN: Cheaper?
TRUMP: Cheaper. He said, it's cheaper. ""Sir—
ROGAN: Not more dangerous?
TRUMP: He just said cheaper. I said, ""I want every plane. I want every tank. I want the goggles."" They have night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have. He said, ""Sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it."" I said, ""So you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan or just fly it directly back?"" ""It's cheaper to leave it."" I said, ""This guy's nuts."" I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them.
But I defeated ISIS with the greatest generals. I had a guy who was so great. I flew to Iraq and I met the real generals, not these idiots that we deal with. And we knocked out—you know, I defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. They said it would take five years. I did it in a matter of a few—literally a few weeks. And we hit them hard. And he said, ""Sir, we're gonna hit them here. We're gonna hit them there. We're gonna hit him here, there."" And I said, ""This guy's great. I like this guy."" I was told it would take five years. That's why I went. I said, ""How could it take five years? We have brand new fighters, we have the best planes, the best weapons, the best guns, the best bombs. How could it possibly take that long?""
And I flew to, I flew in, left at three o'clock in the morning. Nobody knew I was going. I got on Air Force One and we started flying, and when we reached about half an hour away from Iraq, that was where the airport was, big airport, about a half an hour away, they said, ""Sir, I'm sorry, you'll have to turn off all your lights."" ""Why?"" ""We're getting close to our site, our land."" I said, ""We spent $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights."" Think of this, 20 years, $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights on in a plane. I said, ""That's okay. Turn the lights off. I'm not gonna fight them this one.""
ROGAN: This is because it's too dangerous?
TRUMP: Yeah, too dangerous because they see the light up in the air.
ROGAN: They shoot at it.
TRUMP: They'll shoot at it. So, uh, I said, ""Turn the lights off."" Then they said, sir, we're gonna also pull your shades if that's okay."" Said, ""That's okay."" The plane pitch black. All the lights outside, the blinking they call them the blinking reds. They were all turned off. And I like to sit with pilots a lot of times, and these guys are specimens. I always say they're better looking than Tom Cruise. And they're even taller, like perfect specimens. These guys, like for a fighter, you have some guys that are perfect specimens, these guys. you know, They pick the best pilots in the United States Air Force to fly Air Force One.
And I get up there and I'm sitting—I'm feeling my way up. It's up high because 747s you go through the stairs. But I sort of knew my way up. There wasn't a light in the plane. I'm saying, ""Can you imagine? We spent trillions of dollars and we're trying to fly in blind."" But I got into the plane. The cockpit is dark black, little, tiny light, you could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being. His copilot, everybody was perfect. They were all like movie stars. you know, I could have cast a movie with these guys and nobody would believe it because they were too good-looking. So I said, ""How are we doing, Captain?"" ""Sir, we'll be landing in 10 minutes."" And I look outside, there's not a light. And I'm sitting—you know, I've landed a lot of planes and you see little lights at least. There's nothing. It's just pure desert. And I said, ""Okay, Captain, good."" But I'm looking. Now we're—you've been to many planes where it has the computer sign saying 1,000 feet.
It goes, ""1,000, 900, 800."" It's a computer voice but it sounds like—But it's an incredible voice. ""700."" I say, ""Captain, are we okay?"" I'm looking. ""Are we okay, Captain? uh, There's no lights."" And I'm looking—normally when you land—Because I sit with pilots a lot. I think it's great. I think it's a great profession, everything. They're incredible. These machines are incredible. He said, ""Sir, we're fine. No problem, sir."" I said—I'm going, ""I don't see any lights up there, Captain. Sure we're okay?"" So, I'm exaggerating a little bit. Problem with exaggerating, they'll tell the story, they'll say, ""Trump was a coward."" So I'm sitting with him. He goes, ""500"" And I'm telling you, there wasn't a light on the runway, nothing. And we're going in. ""You okay, Captain? Everything good?"" ""Yes, sir. No problem. We'll be down in about one minute, sir."" And I'm telling you, Joe, you know, there's always a light. There's not a little pin.
And all of a sudden, pssh and you hear it, bah, bah, perfect landing like glass. That's how good—These guys between the equipment and—it's genius. It's pure—it was so dark, you couldn't see a thing. There was no runway. You wouldn't know where the hell you are. You're in the middle of a desert. And then I got out of the plane, I said, ""Thank you, Captain. It's a great job."" And then I got out of the plane and I'm going down and I see a general and another general, and I see a staff sergeant, a drill sergeant and various guys, all central casting. Central casting. They said, ""Sir, would you like to rest?"" I said, ""I don't want to rest. I want to figure out what the hell are we doing with ISIS? I'm hearing, we can't—it's gonna take years."" ""No sir. We can do it very quickly, sir.""
And, anyway, we go into the room. Biden would've taken a nap for four days and then left without a meeting. So we go into the room and they have these guys. I say, "" How long can you do it? How long?"" ""We can do it in a couple of weeks, sir."" I said, ""Wait a minute. They told me five years."" ""We can do it in—"" I don't know. He gave me a number like oohh [gestures], like in no time. I said, ""Why haven't you done it?"" ""Because the orders came in from Washington, sir. And they would come here and tell us what to do."" ""Don't you challenge those or—?"" ""We're not allowed to do that, sir. That's not the military way. They tell us what to do and we have to respect them. I just—
ROGAN: So do you think that it was incompetence why they didn't go after ISIS? Do you—
TRUMP: I think it's a bad system. When Mattis goes there or when Milley goes there, who's stupid, and they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do, and the guys that are smart are saying, ""We don't like what they're doing."" But they're not allowed to, sort of, counteract. Plus the guys that went there are arrogant. you know, They're arrogant fools. They're stupid fools. uh, the way they pulled out, you know as an example, the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the planes—
ROGAN: It was a disgrace.
TRUMP: It was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters falling. It was so bad. There was no reason for it. Anyway, so we knocked them out and we have great military, we have great people, but not the television guys. And I rebuilt the military and then they gave a chunk of it—I have to tell you, as much as it is, it's a tiny little piece. Believe it or not. We have an unbelievable—I rebuilt the military. I rebuilt our nuclear, and in a way I hated to redo it, but I got to realize how powerful that nuclear is. Joe, one bomb, Israel is gone. But forget. One bomb could take out the entire East Coast. It's so bad.
And I watched these poor fools talking about our oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 500 years. I mean, we have people, we have countries, right now you have five countries. And don't underestimate, North, North Korea, if you take a look at North Korea, their nuc—I was there. I was with Kim Jong. I got along great rel—I got along great with him. you know, The press is, ""He got along good."" That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a great thing. Obama thought we were gonna go to war with North Korea. When I met with Obama just prior to the takeover, you know, you meet, you have sort of a ceremonial meeting, but it lasted a long time, a lot longer than it was supposed to last. I said, ""What's the biggest problem?"" He said, ""North Korea."" By the time I finished, I was, we had no problem with North Korea. We were really—It was a little tough at the beginning, remember?
ROGAN: Mm-hmm.
TRUMP: He said, ""I have a red button on my desk."" I said, ""I have a red button also, but mine's bigger than yours and mine works.""
ROGAN: I liked how you called them Little Rocket Man.
TRUMP: Yeah, Little Rocket—I said, ""Little Rocket Man, you're gonna burn in hell."" And it was a rough—Oh, so rough that people were worried. This is crazy. And then one day I got a call, sort of like a fight. I got a call. You ever see one of them pounding fight? And then all of a sudden, but I got a call and it was from him, meaning his people, they wanted to meet. They wouldn't meet Obama. He tried to meet. They wouldn't even talk to him about it. And I think he expected to go to war. I actually do. I believe he expected to go. And we checked their nuclear stockpile. It is substantial. I mean it's, I said—I got to know him very well. I got to know him better than anybody. Anybody. And I said, ""Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beach, nice beachfront property."" you know, Kiddingly. I said, ""You're always building nuclear, just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos on your shoreline."" They actually have gorgeous stuff.
And he said, "" uh, I just have to do it because I need it for my safety et cetera."" I got to know him very well. We had no problem with him. If you have a smart problem—If you have a smart, really the right President, the smart President, you're not gonna have a problem. And I say it to people, we have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within. And it drives 'em crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within. We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful. When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe, when you have people coming in that—When other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murderers—We had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years.
ROGAN: And 15,000 rapists, convicted.
TRUMP: Rapists, drug dealers, drug lords, terrorists.
ROGAN: And that's just the ones that have been accounted for.
TRUMP: Correct. People from mental institutions.
ROGAN: What do you think the strategy is?
TRUMP: Hundreds to hundreds of thousands of major criminals, tougher and worse than anybody we have. These are—
ROGAN: Well, we're seeing the consequences of it in San Antonio. They've taken over apartment buildings in Aurora, Colorado. They've taken over—
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: Apartment buildings, these Venezuelan gangs.
TRUMP: Just the beginning.
ROGAN: What do you think the strategy is? you know, One of the things that they've said is that you stopped a bill from being passed. But didn't that bill also include amnesty for the people that are already here?
TRUMP: This is years after the fact. The damage was already done.
ROGAN: But what was the bill? What was the problem with the bill?
TRUMP: And the bill was nothing. It allowed two million people in, they were gonna get amnesty. It was a horrible bill. It didn't protect us at all.
ROGAN: But we should just tell people what the strategy is. So one of the things that's—
TRUMP: Well, [inaudible] what their strategy was.
ROGAN: Their strategy, one of the things that's been very clear is that they've moved a large percentage of these uh, migrants that are coming across the border illegally, they've moved them to swing states. This is what's going on with Springfield, Ohio, right?
TRUMP: They're in swing states. Well, that's not a swing state. I'm gonna win Ohio by a lot. So that's not a swing, but it's called Springfield, Ohio to be exact. And Springfield, Ohio is this very nice community of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants that don't speak the language dropped into their community. You can't get into a hospital. You can't get into a school. It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show. And the mayor is a nice guy. And the mayor says, ""We're looking for interpreters."" I said, ""No, you've got to remove them and bring them back to their country."" Mostly Haitians in this case. But they speak no, they speak no language. They speak no English.
ROGAN: No English you mean.
TRUMP: In fact, even the language, they do speak, I mean they can't get interpreters. They can't do anything. And the mayor's trying to be politically correct. They're all trying to be. In Aurora, Colorado, you have the, the probably the worst gang—MS-13 might even be—you know, those two are the worst gangs. These are Venezuelan gangs. They have taken over apartment complexes and they're gonna want to take over the whole thing. And you have a weak Governor, pathetic Governor, uh, who's a radical left Democrat. He doesn't know what the hell to do. But you have it in many other communities, but they don't like to talk about it because you know, it's bad for the community to talk about it. These people have been let in here by this imbecile. She's—and I mean it, she's a low IQ person. Low IQ.
ROGAN: But also, it's obviously not just her. There's a strategy that's involved in letting these people in.
TRUMP: Well, she was in charge of the border.
ROGAN: Well, she's in charge of the border, but they also, they, they utilize that app. The app that used to be used—
TRUMP: Sure.
ROGAN: It used to be used, I think essentially, wasn't it for shipping? Wasn't it when people were in this country—
TRUMP: It was used for shipping and now it's used to deal with the cartels. The cartel, heads of the cartel, rich people by the way, these are loaded, these people have so much money. They would call up—think of this: They call up the app and the app tells them where they should take their load of illegal migrants from the Congo. We have a lot from the Congo, prisons in the Congo. uh, I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke. A man named Dana White [CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship], who you love, who I love, I assume you love him. I—
ROGAN: Love that dude.
TRUMP: I think he's in a class by him—He's—
ROGAN: He's probably the reason why you're here.
TRUMP: I, I, I don't know. Maybe.
ROGAN: He's one of the big ones.
TRUMP: He is the greatest guy.
ROGAN: I love him to death.
TRUMP: I always say nobody's indispensable. Everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can't be. You might not be. But they know I truly, I don't think—you know the thing, they sold it for four billion. I said, ""Wha the hell, who the hell is gonna pay four billion?"" And they made like a great deal.
ROGAN: It's worth a lot more than that now.
TRUMP: Because of him. Take him out, I think it's whole different ball game but—
ROGAN: No, he's the best fight promoter of all time.
TRUMP: He's also the greatest guy. He spoke my, at the whole thing with I had just been shot and he got up and he spoke so, better than anybody. I mean, who would be better to introduce you? I asked, of all the people, and I know the biggest people in the world, and they all would've loved to have done it. I said, ""Dana, would you do it?"" you know, It was interesting. He was away. And he said to the people, one of my guys called, said, ""I won't be able to do it. She had just left with my wife and family, I won't."" I said, ""Ooh."" He said, ""No, yeah.""
I was a little surprised, even though I knew he was very far away. He was in some place some—you know, And he deserved it with his family, you know, the whole thing. And then I said, ""All right. That's—"" So we're looking at who are we gonna get. And all of a sudden she comes in, ""Sir, Dana White just said he's going to do it. And he's coming back in tonight. He's taking it."" But, you know, The guy is just an incredible guy. And, he's like a tough champion, but loyal. Yeah, he's got to be one of your favorite people. He's one of my favorite people.
ROGAN: [inaudible]. I love me to death. I've been friends with him for 23 years. I love him to death.
TRUMP: So would you have—uh, Because what you're doing here is incredible. I mean, everybody tells me. All I know is today I'm going—""You're on Joe Rogan today."" People are telling me like that's—. I say, ""How the hell do you know that?"" But, its uh, it's what you've done here is amazing. Where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff? Would you have this show, do you think?
ROGAN: Yeah, I would still be doing it for sure. Yeah, I'm doing it—
TRUMP: Would it be at the same level?
ROGAN: I don't know.
TRUMP: But you would have the show?
ROGAN: It's hard to know. I think you know, one of the things that works for this show, I guess, is that I am involved in so many different things. you know, Stand-up, comedy, the UFC and all the interests that I have that lead to the podcast.
TRUMP: Will you always want to do—First of all, you love UFC?
ROGAN: I love it. Yeah.
TRUMP: You love the fights. I watch you. You are loving it. They could pay you nothing, you'd be very—
ROGAN: They didn't pay me anything. For the first 13 shows, I did it for free because they were hemorrhaging money. And I became friends with Dana, and uh, my position was, ""You're gonna give me the best seat in the house. I get to sit cage side for the fights."" I go, ""I'll do it."" And I wanted to help. I was like, ""I think these are the guys that we had always hoped for.""
TRUMP: He's an amazing guy.
ROGAN: In the early days of the sport, I started working for the company in 1997, I was before the UFC was purchased by Zuffa, which Dana worked for.
TRUMP: Oh, wow. Wow.
ROGAN: So I was a part of the previous owners, and I only did it for a couple of years. It was just too much and I was losing money. And it was banned from cable because of uh, Budweiser and John McCain, and you could only get it on Direct TV. And so—
TRUMP: And then I came along and I gave him the sites.
ROGAN: You did. And he loves you for that.
TRUMP: And he never forgot it.
ROGAN: He loves you for that. He talks about it all the time.
TRUMP: Just to interrupt you for one sec. So, they couldn't get a site because it was too dangerous and everybody was against it and they couldn't get licensed. And I gave him the first two or three sites. And they were great. And by the way, I went to the first fight. I said, ""I never saw anything like this."" It was crazy. It was so good. Take the best fight you've ever—It was like that fight. It was so good that I gave it to him again, and again. And all of a sudden it caught on.
But you know, when I wasn't in vogue, I've had time, you probably never had a time, but I had times when I wasn't exactly in vogue. Dana, they called him, he said, ""He's the greatest guy. There's nobody like him."" He said, ""I'll never say anything bad about that guy because when I needed—"" Because they were having a hard time at the beginning, they almost pulled the plug a couple of times, right? He said, ""He stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else gave us, and nobody wanted anything to do."" And he said, ""I will never—"" And there was a time where it would've been very popular for him to say bad stuff about me. He said the greatest stuff about me. He said, ""You're gonna try and get me to say bad stuff about Trump but I'm never doing it."" So he's—
ROGAN: He's a very, very, very loyal guy.
TRUMP: An unusual guy.
ROGAN: Very unusual guy.
TRUMP: He's a fantastic guy.
ROGAN: A perfect guy to be at the helm of something so controversial as the UFC.
TRUMP: Less controversial, I mean, now certainly.
ROGAN: Well, now it's huge. Well, this was always the thing that I would hope that it would be. I always knew that it was unbelievably entertaining, but I just didn't know if maybe I was crazy. Maybe I loved it because I've had this long history of being involved in martial arts and maybe like other people who just think it's too violent. But—
TRUMP: Can boxing make it?
ROGAN: Yeah. Boxing's still a great sport. I love boxing.
TRUMP: But it seems to be—so unimportant now by comparison to UFC, don't you think?
ROGAN: I think—Well, you know, Dana is working with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They're, they're gonna start promoting boxing now.
TRUMP: [inaudible].
ROGAN: And with Dana at the helm of it, I think boxing could return, because the thing is, they want to make fights that other peop—maybe other promoters don't want to make because they want to protect their fighter. Controversial fights where it's dangerous. You don't know, this guy could lose. And so the Saudis, they're smart. They just offer a tremendous amount of money, and they're putting together fighters, fights that no one else can put together. They're doing that in boxing.
TRUMP: If Dana's involved, he'll probably make it good.
ROGAN: He'll make it good.
TRUMP: The amazing thing though, the, the, in fighting, no UFC fighter they say has ever died, and it looks to me much more violent than boxing. Many boxers have died. Isn't it interesting? And Dana tells me because they take so many shots to the face.
ROGAN: Yes and there's also no other options to preserve yourself, to protect yourself. So if you get hit in a UFC fight, you can clinch, you can try to take the fight to the ground. You got options. Also, you don't get allowed to get knocked down and then get back up. When you get knocked down, you're concussed. And generally, if a guy's really hurt, they could be finished in, on the ground and the fight's over. If it's boxing, you have 10 seconds to get up. You get up, your head kind of clears, but you're still in real bad trouble, and then you can run away and survive until the bell rings. They're only three minute rounds, and then you start again. So you're getting repeated punishment to the head.
And then there's also the issue of guys weight cutting, which is a problem with the UFC as well. But weight cutting and boxing has led to—if you look at deaths in boxing, there's very few of them in the heavyweight division. Most of the deaths in boxing are the lighter weight divisions.
TRUMP: Wow, oh, that's interesting.
ROGAN: Because when guys dehydrate themselves to lose weight, to make weight, their brain is the last thing that gets rehydrated. like It's very difficult to completely rehydate, rehydrate your brain quickly. And you only have 24 hours between the weigh-in and the fight. And it used to be, the weigh-ins were the day of the fight. Like when ""Boom Boom"" Mancini had a fight with Duck Koo Kim and killed him in the ring, which is one of the last ones on television that we've seen—
TRUMP: That's right.
ROGAN: That was a crazy event for people and heartbreaking. And it led to a bunch of different changes. And one of them is day before weigh-ins to allow people to rehydrate better. And the other one is they dropped it from 15 rounds down to 12.
TRUMP: Which, look, they should do that. you know, I'm not, I'm not the fighter, but those 15 round fights were unbelievable.
ROGAN: They were unbelievable.
TRUMP: They were unbelievable. In terms of—
ROGAN: You go back to the golden age—
TRUMP: In terms of entertainment, those were the championship reps. Those were the greatest fights ever.
ROGAN: Those last three rounds were crazy.
TRUMP: That was brutal.
ROGAN: It's such a war of attrition. you know, A lot of people think even a five-round UFC fight, the, the UFC is five-minute rounds, it's so much energy you're burning out. And those last couple of rounds, those five round fights, the fourth and the fifth round, unbelievably brutal.
TRUMP: Who's the greatest UFC fighter, in your—are you allowed to say, in your opinion? It's tough for you to say because you do this, but who do you think is the greatest of the fighters?
ROGAN: There's, there's a lot of arguments for who's the greatest of all time. you know, Jon Jones, most people would say is the greatest of all time. Never lost. uh, It's, there's certainly a really good argument for that. There's another argument for Georges St-Pierre. I always leave in B.J. Penn in his prime, Anderson Silva in his prime. uh, Mighty Mouse, people forget about Mighty Mouse because unfortunately he's a smaller guy. He's a 125 pounds flyweight champion. He's one of the greatest expressions—
TRUMP: [inaudible].
ROGAN: Of mixed martial arts I've ever seen. I think to this day he's probably—
TRUMP: And Khabib. What about Khabib?
ROGAN: Khabib is fantastic. But if you looked at accomplishments in terms of championship fights, Khabib retired 29-0, but he didn't have as many world championship fights.
TRUMP: And probably never lost a round. They say he—
ROGAN: He might've lost to Gleison Tibau. He might've lost to him.
TRUMP: A round.
ROGAN: He might've lost a round. And that was a controversial fight where people think that Gleison Tibau could have even got the decision in that fight. I'd have to go back and watch it again to make a decision. But—
TRUMP: They're, great athletes, though.
ROGAN: Oh, the best athletes in the world, and the, the, the most dangerous sport in terms of like—I always call it high level problem solving with dire physical consequences.
TRUMP: Yes. It's just brutal.
ROGAN: That's what fighting is.
TRUMP: I'll never forget, so there was a fighter named James Toney.
ROGAN: Oh, yeah. I love James Toney. ""Lights Out.""
TRUMP: He fought as a very light fighter and he ended up as a heavyweight. This guy went through everything. He was almost like a lightweight.
ROGAN: He went from middleweight all the way up to heavyweight.
TRUMP: And, and, and, I've never seen that.
ROGAN: Even Evander Holyfield is a heavyweight.
TRUMP: And he was a real fighter.
ROGAN: Oh, yeah.
TRUMP: So James Toney and I think it was uh, St. George—
ROGAN: George St-Pierre.
TRUMP: St-Pierre. I think was him. Who did he fight? James Toney—
ROGAN: No, James Toney didn't fight Georges St-Pierre.
TRUMP: He fought a UFC fighter.
ROGAN: Yeah, Randy Couture fought James Toney.
TRUMP: Was it Randy Couture? Maybe.
ROGAN: That was an easy fight. That was a very easy fight. Randy Couture just took him down and strangled him.
TRUMP: It was the most—And he's half the size. And he just, once he got to the ankles—In fact, the announcer said, ""It's over."" And he put him to sleep.
ROGAN: He ankle picked him, took him down, mounted him, strangled him. It was pretty quick.
TRUMP: And James, he was a nice guy, but he was talking big because he was much bigger. He was a pretty big guy.
ROGAN: I think James just wanted to make some money in that fight.
TRUMP: You think so?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: But I never forgot it.
ROGAN: [inaudible].
TRUMP: It was over very quickly. And he's lying, sleeping on the mat and he was talking, he was doing the Muhammad Ali stuff, but it didn't work out. But I remember—
ROGAN: He sold the fight.
TRUMP: Yeah, that was Couture probably, wasn't it?
ROGAN: Yeah, it was Couture. George never fought a boxer in an MMA fight. If he did, he would kill them. George—
TRUMP: Was he, was he one of the greatest?
ROGAN: Yes, unquestionably. The argument, there's a handful of guys you can make the argument is the greatest of all time. People forget about Anderson Silva. In his prime, he was unstoppable. But that's the thing is—
TRUMP: Anderson Silva.
ROGAN: And then there's Fedor Emelianenko who fought Pride. In his prime he was unstoppable. There's this—
TRUMP: And you have a couple now that are pretty good.
ROGAN: Yes. Oh, we've got so many now. Alex Pereira.
TRUMP: Correct.
ROGAN: There's an argument that he's the top pound for pound fighter in the world right now.
TRUMP: He's looking very good.
ROGAN: He's unbelievable. But it's like, fighters can only compete at that level for so many years. And so in my opinion, you have to judge them at their very peak. You can't judge them when they're hanging on and still fighting. You can't judge them when they're coming up. You got to judge them in that championship peak and that championship peak, there's a handful of guys that you would consider at the very top.
TRUMP: If they stopped a little bit sooner, some of them would've had—you know, There are a couple of that you just mentioned without mentioning names, if they stopped, they had the perfect—they were unbelievable. And then at a certain age, they start getting knocked out, right?
ROGAN: Yes, it's unfortunate. But the thing is, that same belief in themselves that lets them become a champion makes—
TRUMP: It's okay.
ROGAN: Them think that they can do it long past the time that they actually can.
TRUMP: Well, Anderson Silva was essentially unbeatable and then he lost a close one. Then all of a sudden he had—
ROGAN: No, he got knocked out. He got knocked out by Chris Weidman. He was kind of clowning in that fight famously. And Chris Weidman had a vicious left hook, knocked him out, and then they fought a second time and he broke his leg on Chris Weidman.
TRUMP: Right, that's right.
ROGAN: And after that fight, he was kind of never the same because that that leg break injury, which Conor McGregor had, there's quite a few fighters that—
TRUMP: That was a bad one.
ROGAN: Weidman actually wound up having the same injury, ironically. There's only been like four of these.
TRUMP: You're never the same because you can't kick.
ROGAN: You're never the same. Well, you can. Weidman is still kicking with that leg. You can but, psychologically, when you throw a kick and your leg snaps in half and you're in agony for a year, right, you have to get surgery, you have to get bolts and plates to keep your leg together, and then it takes forever for it to heal.
TRUMP: It always amazed me how the kicker—I mean, you have those cases—but the kicker will do tremendous damage to somebody's leg, but their leg doesn't seem to get damaged. Isn't it sort of amazing?
ROGAN: It does get damaged. It hurts.
TRUMP: More than you think.
ROGAN: Your shin, you, you, you shin gets very numb after a while. And guys that are really good kickers, they're kicking the thigh and they're kicking the calf.
TRUMP: They're kicking that.
ROGAN: They're kicking soft areas and they're slamming this hard numb shin. Their shin gets all these like micro fractures all over the shin and it calcifies.
TRUMP: Oh, wow.
ROGAN: These guys can kick baseball bats. You ever seen them break baseball bats with their shins?
TRUMP: I've never seen.
ROGAN: It's crazy. Some guys can do two baseball bats. Some will hold the baseball bat and they just kick right through them. But their shins almost get numb.
TRUMP: But see, I watch your enthusiasm now, right?
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: And it's like, that's why you're good at what—nobody does this better. Without the enthusiasm, forget it.
ROGAN: Well, it has to be authentic. The only reason why I do MMA commentary is because I am very interested in it for real. I don't have to manufacture it. I'm very interested. So I think that's why—
TRUMP: And you love going in there after the fight, and they're sweating all over you. They're slopping all over you. You're beautiful.
ROGAN: They bleed on me.
TRUMP: They're bleeding on—
ROGAN: Sometimes their nose is bleeding—
TRUMP: Does that bother you a little bit?
ROGAN: No.
TRUMP: Like two weeks ago when the guy was—I never saw it.
ROGAN: Khalil Rountree.
TRUMP: He—more stuff came out of his nose.
ROGAN: Yes. It was pretty nasty. But no, I'm very used to it. I just wanted him to be able to—
TRUMP: That's great.
ROGAN: —express himself.
TRUMP: You've done a great job.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: You've done a great job.
ROGAN: So back to you and back to—what are you—and, first of all, I love this idea of you teaming up with Robert Kennedy, and I love this make America healthy again idea. Because there are chemicals and ingredients that are in our food that are illegal in other countries because they've been shown to be toxic. There's pesticides and herbicides and there's a lot of shit that's been sprayed on our food that really is unnecessary. And there's a lot of health consequences that people are suffering from a lot of these things.
TRUMP: I brought this chart for you.
ROGAN: Beautiful.
TRUMP: Because I had a feeling you'd be asking me.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: Look at this chart. These are healthier countries. Look where the United States is. I'm gonna send this to R.F.K Jr. Look at that.
ROGAN: So this is—well, something along the lines—I was actually talking to R.F.K today and he told me that more than 70% of young men are ineligible for the military because of their health.
TRUMP: I could see it. A lot of it's—
ROGAN: That's crazy.
TRUMP: A lot of it's obesity.
ROGAN: So here's the life expectancy versus health expenditure.
TRUMP: Same chart. Did you see that?
ROGAN: USA.
TRUMP: Wow, that's pretty good. Jamie's the best.
He's very good.
ROGAN: He's the best.
TRUMP: No, but look at that. Look where the USA is.
ROGAN: It's not good. And that's our food. That's our diet. That's sedentary lifestyle. That's our diet. That's the chemicals we ingest. That's what that is.
TRUMP: But R.F.K is gonna be very—you know, I think he's a great guy. I think he's great.
ROGAN: I love the fact that you guys teamed up. And are you guys, are you completely—
TRUMP: It's a good combination.
ROGAN: —committed to have him a part of your Administration?
TRUMP: Oh, I am. But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental, because you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas. I think you know, it's—
ROGAN: Just keep him out of that.
TRUMP: —the fire. So I'm gonna keep him out of a little. I said, ""Focus on health, focus, you can do whatever you want."" But I uh, got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know.
ROGAN: I understand. But listen, there's plenty of good work that could be done if you focus on health.
TRUMP: Here's the one, here's the one that my all-time favorite though.
ROGAN: What is that?
TRUMP: See the arrow right here. That's when I left. The day I left.
ROGAN: Do you have anyone that is pressuring you to not work with him? Have there been people that have reached—
TRUMP: To not work with who?
ROGAN: R.F.K. Jr.
TRUMP: Yes.
ROGAN: Yes? I would imagine. Because financially he could put a dent—
TRUMP: I would say that—and you know, I think in many ways they've done a good job, in many ways they've done a bad job. But I would say that the uh, big pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that, you know I have a—I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. He thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides, on all this stuff, and then you end up at—that chart is a terrible chart, the one previous. It's such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don't spend 10 cents. So, and you save a lot of money. But yeah, we've, I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled. You can imagine, right?
ROGAN: Sure.
TRUMP: It's a good question actually.
ROGAN: Well, uh, certainly if there have been—
TRUMP: It doesn't affect me.
ROGAN:—some pharmaceutical drugs that have been prescribed that have negative consequences that these people have been profiting off of, and then you have a guy, RFK Junior, who spends an enormous amount of time highlighting those things, you could see how they'd be very reluctant to have you support him.
TRUMP: I would say that's an understatement, yes.
ROGAN: Yeah. So what do you do to stop that from getting in the way?
TRUMP: Well look, they've come up with some amazing things. I mean, I don't know how you feel. I know you're against the vaccines, certain vaccines. But like the polio vaccine, people had polio, they were, it was like a disaster. And they came up, Dr. Salk, and he came up with a vaccine, and there's no polio. Now, uh, very interesting there hasn't been polio, but now in the Gaza Strip—can you believe that? Have you heard that? There's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip?
ROGAN: Is it vaccine-derived polio? Because there's a strain of polio that comes directly from the vaccine. Because unfortunately, sometimes when you vaccinate—
TRUMP: I don't know.
ROGAN:—people for polio, you have to give them polio.
TRUMP: Oh, I see. See, I haven't heard that. Yeah.
ROGAN: Yeah.
TRUMP: I mean, all I can do is I sit down and I listen to him, and—and I'll give it total—I would love him to be right, because it's, if he's right, it's a lot less expensive, generally speaking.
ROGAN: There's two things that people point to when they point to uh, the dangers of uh, the pharmaceutical drug industry. One thing is when pharmaceutical drugs were allowed to advertise on television. We're only one of two countries in the world that allow pharmaceutical drugs to advertise on TV. The other one's New Zealand, but they're more restrictive than we are. People are worried—
TRUMP: But those ads, when you hear, you know, ""Take a certain drug""—
ROGAN: And then you hear all the consequences.
TRUMP:—and then you say, ""It causes cancer and baldness,"" we don't like baldness here.
ROGAN: Suicidal ideation.
TRUMP: And this, and that, and eyesight, and you can lose your vision. And you know, I actually asked one of these guys, ""I would never take—"" I mean, it causes things that are so bad, they go through a whole list. I guess they save some liability, but, man. I said, ""Does that affect the purchase?"" They say it really does. When they, there's something you have and you read, and then they go through the list of—
ROGAN: Side effects.
TRUMP:—the potential side—it's not even—the potential side effects. I mean, a lot of people are just—I asked that question. People hear that. When I hear it, I, I am gonna take a pass. It says, ""May affect your vision, may cause blindness, may this—""
ROGAN: Yes. Well, I know you're aware of Calley and Casey Means, right?
TRUMP: Yes.
ROGAN: Well, one of the things that they pointed out, and this is a very important thing for people to understand, is what a lot of these drugs do is they, they act to somehow or another mitigate the effects of poor metabolic health. But most of these problems that these people are suffering from wouldn't exist if we put an emphasis on metabolic health. If people got healthier, they started eating nutritious food, taking vitamins, a whole host of these problems that people are having would go away. And the problem with that from the pharmaceutical drug standpoint is they wouldn't be able to sell drugs to these people. And this is a fear that a lot of people have.
TRUMP: And the pesticides and things like that on the plants. What do you think of that?
ROGAN: It's terrible. Well, I think regenerative agriculture, unfortunately, is very difficult to scale to a point where you got a Jack-in-the-Box on every corner.
TRUMP: Right. That's right. That's right.
ROGAN: If everybody wants food, and we have food deserts, and we have places like Los Angeles where no one's growing anything and everything has to be shipped in, it's very difficult to feed that many people. We've created this incredible society where we have these enormous cities, but it's very difficult to get food to these people. And then for a lot of these people in low-income areas, the only food that's available is cheap, unhealthy food. And we could fix that. That, that's—if we could send $175 billion to Ukraine, we could do something to fix a lot of the health problems that the United States has. And I think it would hur—help us as a nation overall, if you just put it out there that, ""Hey, as a nation, we're gonna make a concerted effort to get people healthier."" Just put it out there and people start making better choices.
TRUMP: Well, when you look at that chart, I was—
ROGAN: It's crazy.
TRUMP: They just gave me that chart because they said, ""You may want to discuss this topic,"" which I know is a big topic for you. And when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation, that's a pretty big thing.
ROGAN: How are you so healthy? Is it golf?
TRUMP: No, it's genetics, I believe. I'm a big believer—
ROGAN: Genetics is a big factor.
TRUMP: I really am. My father, uh, was, he was an old guy—
ROGAN: Unfortunately, it is a big factor for health. Some people are just way more robust. But you do play golf a lot, and that is exercise.
TRUMP: Both of my parents—it, it, for me, it's good.
ROGAN: Fresh air—
TRUMP: It really is. It's fresh air—
ROGAN:—exercise,
TRUMP:—you're outside. Even mentally, you are focused on that three-footer, and for a couple of hours you're not—And I go quick. I play fast, real fast, and I'm in, I'm out. But you know, it gives me—I was never one that could run on a treadmill, and I just, I can do it. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill, and then they make it steeper, and steeper, and steeper. And the doctor said, it was at Walter Reed, they said, ""It's unbelievable."" I couldda gone, I'm telling you, I felt I could have gone all day. But I said, ""Doc, I can do this all day long. I'm not, I have no problem."" But it's boring to me, do you understand?
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: It's just boring.
ROGAN: Golf's exciting.
TRUMP: But I did it for so long, they couldn't believe it, that I did it. And I never did, I don't do it, I don't really—I have friends that run on this stuff all day long. But I had no problem doing it, but it's really boring. So with golf or something, or tennis, or whatever, but golf, as you get older, there's something really good about it. And you have competition with your friends, you know, there's something—
ROGAN: Competition, concentration, focus.
TRUMP: And it's a great handicap sport.
ROGAN: And it's also a thing, I think, uh, it cleans your mind because when you're looking at a shot, that's all you can think of, when you're executing.
TRUMP: It gives you a couple of hours. you know, It's interesting, with tennis, if you're much better than somebody, you can't really play with somebody. you know, It doesn't work. You can give them the equivalent of strokes, right, but it's not the same. With golf, you can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke a hole or two strokes a hole or something. It's a good handicapping sport.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: But it gives me a little exercise. But I haven't played uh, in a long time. I won 32 club championships, can you believe it?
ROGAN: Didn't you play right after you got shot?
TRUMP: uh, No. What I did is I played with Bryson DeChambeau. Do you know Bryson?
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: The pro. He's a great player. And we played, it was a certain thing that we played, I guess called breaking 50 or something. 50, we play from a certain tee, and if you can break 50—And it got tremendous ratings, it was sort of like a crazy thing. He's a great guy. He's a great—
ROGAN: But wasn't that a couple of days after you got shot?
TRUMP: I don't know. I know I haven't—
ROGAN: That was one of the funniest things, you were on the golf course.
TRUMP: I may have. I think I did. Yeah, maybe I did. But you know, I view it very interestingly. I'm running for President of the United States, to me, it's such a big deal. It's so important. So I've got now—
ROGAN: Well, it's the biggest deal in the free world?
TRUMP: It's 100 times bigger than the Super Bowl, and it's one person. So you're down to two people, and we start off at nine billion, because you have nine billion, they say, in the world. Who knows what that number is? But you get down to 350 million. Sadly, we have no idea what we have in this country, but let's assume it's 325, 350. And you're down to two people. It's the biggest thing in the world. And when I heard she took off yesterday, and she took off the day before, and she's gonna take off tomorrow or the next day—I haven't taken a day off in 56 days. That's a long time. I haven't taken one day off. I didn't, I don't want to play golf, this is too exciting. Golf is great, but this is too exciting. This is more exciting than anything you can do. And the thing is—
ROGAN: Also, it's the homestretch.
TRUMP: It's the homestretch. Who would take a day off? So we have 11 days left now, and, think of it, so I think I've gone 54, 55 days in a row, no days off. And I make speeches oftentimes, you know, sometimes not, but I make speeches. And when you make a speech—and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, I mean I weave stories it, and if you don't, if you just read a teleprompter, nobody's gonna be very excited. You got to weave it out. But as you say, you always have to get right back to what—Otherwise it's no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around. But it's a big strain on your—you know, It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. uh, You gotta be careful with the voice. You can lose that voice. The voice wasn't designed—I said today—
So, I made a big one last night. I was in Las Vegas, a big one the night before in Arizona, big one. I mean, they're all big. We have the—there's never been anything like it in terms of crowds. Never been close. Never been close. They say, ""He talks about crowd size."" You know what's very interesting? So we get crowds that are really big. And I say, ""You know, I've never had a story—"" Because I don't get good press. I don't think I've had a good story in years. I really don't. I don't, I swear, I don't think I—You were talking about it a little bit with Oprah how everybody loved me. I don't think, I became President of the United State, I did great the second time, I did much better. I don't want to get you in any disputes, but I won that second election so easy. And not just because of—
ROGAN: But let me get to that.
TRUMP: But wait.
ROGAN: I want to talk to you about that.
TRUMP: But here's the thing. I did that and now I've gotten the nomination again. And don't forget to get these nominations, you go against very smart people. Ron DeSantis was hot, gotta go through him. Nikki Haley was hot, had to go through her. I went through everybody, record time, right? Record time. I got three nominations in a row, uh, won the first time, did much better the second time. you know, I get millions of votes more the second time. And now I'm doing it a third time. And, and it's an incredible thing, I never get a good story. I only get bad press. Now, I will say this, it's a lot easier if you're a Democrat. If I were a Democrat—
ROGAN: You'd get a lot of positive press.
TRUMP: I would get a lot of positive press.
ROGAN: Yeah, no, it's a creepy, corrupt business. And the, the media, to a large extent, acts as a propaganda arm for the Democratic Party.
TRUMP: It's not even believable.
ROGAN: Yeah. It's believ—it's bizarre to watch. And most, most young people I think are aware of it. I think most boomers still unfortunately read the newspapers and believe in CNN.
TRUMP: But it's getting younger. Let me tell you. It's getting for us, for a conservative—And I don't even—
ROGAN: But you know why that is?
TRUMP: I consider myself a person—
ROGAN: It's the internet.
TRUMP: I think so.
ROGAN: It's because the internet's giving people information that they're not getting from anywhere else. And like the ""Very fine people"" hoax, the Russiagate hoax, all these different things that they've done, they tried to pin on you, it's a clear distortion of what you actually said.
TRUMP: The bloodbath hoax.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: I was talking about the auto industry. It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our auto. And I said, ""It's a bloodbath."" They said, ""Ah, he used the word ""bloodbath."" You know, you'd think if somebody—
ROGAN: You said if you don't win, it's gonna be a bloodbath because they're gonna take over.
TRUMP: That's right. That's right.
ROGAN: That's exactly what you said.
TRUMP: It's a terrible thing they do.
ROGAN: But that's the problem with propagandists, because they take things out of context. And ultimately what they do is they diminish their own credibility because people don't want to listen to them anymore, because they see that they've done that, and they recognize what's going on, and they feel insulted. Their intelligence is getting insulted.
TRUMP: Well look at the ratings. Shows like yours—So I have a son who's very smart and tall, Baron. Right? And he knows all about you. He knows about guys I never heard of. He said, ""Dad, you don't know how big they are. They're big."" He was telling me how big. I said, ""Who the hell is he?"" Like Ross, I didn't—He said, ""Dad, he's a great guy."" I mean, guys that are doing—It's a whole new world out there.
ROGAN: It's a different world. And I think—
TRUMP: But I'm on TikTok now.
ROGAN: Congratulations.
TRUMP: And I've done really well. No, but you know the crazy? Have you seen the numbers? I've billions like billions of hits. It's crazy.
ROGAN: I'm sure. TikTok's a wild application though.
TRUMP: And I've gone up 30 points. A Republican is always down 30 with young people. I'm plus 30, and I'm on Tok, TikTok.
ROGAN: I think young people—
TRUMP: Its had a huge impact.
ROGAN: Young people are rejecting a lot of this woke bullshit.
TRUMP: Yeah, they are.
ROGAN: Young people are tired of being yelled at and scolded. They're tired of these people that they think are mentally ill telling them what the moral standards of society should be today. People are upset.
TRUMP: It's a big difference—there's a big difference now, even in just a couple of years—I was shaking hands with people. They're young people—
ROGAN: The rebels are Republicans now.
TRUMP: Yeah, I never thought about it that way. I think you're right.
ROGAN: They're like, ""You want to be a rebel? You want to be punk rock? You want to buck the system? You're a conservative now."" That's, that's how crazy. And then the liberals are now pro, pro silencing criticism. They're, they're pro censorship online. They're, they're talking about regulating free speech and regulating the First Amendment. It's bananas to watch.
TRUMP: Joe, they come after their political opponent.
ROGAN: Well, they do.
TRUMP: I got more guys—I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the meanest of them all. He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you, right? I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone only because it's political opponent stuff. And I've won. I won the big case in Florida. I'm winning the other stuff. You win. But you know what they did? They did something that's only done in Third World countries, they came after their political opponent.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
ROGAN: Well, not only that, but then they're weaponizing it by saying that that's what you're going to do once you get in office.
TRUMP: Of course, yeah. Yeah, isn't it great?
ROGAN: Ignoring what they're doing right now. It's crazy.
TRUMP: I heard it, somebody was defending me today, says, ""No, that's—"" They say, ""That's what you're doing to him."" They're going, ""He's gonna put us in jail. He's gonna invest—""
ROGAN: That's what you're doing.
TRUMP: They said, ""That's what you're doing to him."" A lot of people say, ""Will you do that? Will you do that to him, to them if you win?"" The presidency has tremendous power. I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.
ROGAN: I respected that you didn't.
TRUMP: I didn't.
ROGAN: Because what you said was, ""It would be bad for the country.""
TRUMP: No, I couldn't even imagine. You have, first of all, Secretary of State, but more importantly, the wife of the President of the United States of America going into jail. And if you ever saw, when I'd say something about her, they're all say—I didn't say it. I never said it. They say, ""Lock her up. Lock her up."" And I'd always go, ""Take it easy. Just relax. We're gonna win this thing. Take it easy. Take it easy."" And I'm telling you, I kept it down, just the opposite. Now they say, ""Oh, Trump wanted to put her in jail."" No, I saved her from going to jail. They had more stuff on her.
And Comey had it, because when Comey got up—and he stupidly, because he's a stupid guy too—he's a stupid son of a bitch. He got up, Joe, he got up, and instead of saying she's innocent of all charges, he went over each charge, and each charge was a killer. And he'd go, ""And as far as her doing this, she's innocent. And this—"" And then he said, ""Only an unfair prosecutor would go—"" But every time you heard these charges, they sounded so bad. They were bad. And all it was is he wanted more airtime. If you would've gone up and said, ""I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton, and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong,"" it would've ended. Instead, he wanted to be up there because he's a, he's a PR hound. He's a hog. And he starts going through the—and you know what he had? They had a huge problem, because FBI is great, the people there. Not the top people, the people, the real people, the people that work there. It's like the real generals that I told you about that defeated ISIS in record time. The FBI guys are great. I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI.
ROGAN: I bet that's right.
TRUMP: Underneath—and, and so here's the thing. So he goes with Hillary, and instead of just saying, he goes through each charge.
ROGAN: Right, which looks damning. Yeah.
TRUMP: And even I would say, ""Man, those are bad charges."" And this is before I got—
ROGAN: Sounds terrible because it's associating her with those charges,
TRUMP: Don't forget, this is before I got there.
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Now, he was trying to protect her, but he did her a great disservice.
ROGAN: Because he wanted attention.
TRUMP: He was stupid.
ROGAN: So, I want to talk about 2020, because you said over and over again that you were robbed in 2020.
TRUMP: Yeah, totally.
ROGAN: How do you think you were robbed? Everybody always cuts you off. I'm gonna allow—
TRUMP: They do. Well, they not only cut you off. Well, what I'd rather do is we'll do it another time, and I would bring in papers that you would not believe. So many different papers. That election was so crooked. It was the most crooked election.
ROGAN: Okay, but give me some examples of how.
TRUMP: Well, let's start, let's start on the top and the easy ones.
ROGAN: Okay.
TRUMP: They were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did, and they didn't get it. In many cases, they didn't get it.
ROGAN: What things?
TRUMP: Anything. When they made—
ROGAN: Legislative approval of?
TRUMP: Like for extensions of the voting, for, for, for voting earlier, for this, all different things. By law, they had to get legislative approvals. You don't have to go any further than that. If you take a look at Wisconsin, uh, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed, and stolen. They wouldn't give access in certain areas to the ballots because the ballots weren't signed. They weren't originals. They were—we could go into this stuff. We could go into the ballots or we could go into the overall. I'll give you another one.
ROGAN: Are you gonna present this ever?
TRUMP: Well, let me—
ROGAN: Do you think like in a—
TRUMP: Let me just give you one more before.
ROGAN: Okay, go ahead.
TRUMP: 51 intelligence agents come up that the laptop was from Russia. It turned out to be totally false. It wasn't—
ROGAN: 51 former intelligence agents, right?
TRUMP: They say that made—I don't believe it's this much, but it doesn't matter. I won by like—I lost by—I didn't lose. But, they say I lost—Joe, they say I lost by 22,000 votes. That's like one 10th of 1% less than that. It's a tiny little thing. 22,000 votes, spread over, that's spread over this, this period. So 51 intelligence agents lied. They lied. They lied. They knew it was. It was Hunter's. It was from his bed. It was Hunter's laptop. They said it was created by Russia. Russia, Russia. Russia. It was the Russia hoax. The Russia hoax was a big hoax. It was all a big hoax. So they get more—
ROGAN: Well, that's clear. That's one example. That is a good example.
TRUMP: But that is a big example. They say it made a 17 point difference. That's a big example. But that's only one. And you could go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots. You could go into the ballot harvesting. You could go into $500 million for the lock boxes.
ROGAN: But just in terms of narrative, so there's two things. There's the Russia hoax, there's the collusion with Russia that was never proven. Right? That's one.
TRUMP: No, it was proven it didn't happen.
ROGAN: Right. Right, but they uh, they talked about it on television as if it was a—
TRUMP: But it took two and a half years to prove.
ROGAN: But not only that, but it was a constant narrative on television. That's a constant narrative that gets into people's minds, especially low-information people that just watch the news, that you're in collusion with Russia. So that's one. So that changes the narrative. And then you have the 51 former intelligence agents that work with the original Twitter and get them to remove links. You can't share it on DMs. You cannot share that story. They swept that story because they said it was Russian disinformation, even though they knew it was not.
TRUMP: 100%.
ROGAN: So that's two examples that are real examples. Now, anyone who considers himself a legitimate objective observer of American politics, if you really want the best person to win, you would want people to not lie. And the only reason why they got away with this lie was because they continually labeled you as this horrible threat to democracy, and Hitler. They kept saying you're gonna be a dictator, ignoring the fact that you weren't a dictator for the four years where you actually the President.
TRUMP: Correct, the opposite. I was actually the opposite of a dictator. I was a very straight guy. But look, those three things, you take those three things, each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different, okay?
ROGAN: It does.
TRUMP: And then you can go into 100 other things. There's so many. We can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders. We need, we need a—to have a country, you need borders, you need fair elections. And I'll tell you the other thing you need is you need a free and fair press. One of the things I like about doing a show like this, can you imagine Kamala doing this show?
ROGAN: I could imagine her doing the show.
TRUMP: She'd be laying on the floor—
ROGAN: I would try—she was supposed to do it, and she might still do it.
TRUMP: She wasn't gonna do it.
ROGAN: And I hope she does.
TRUMP: She's not going do it.
ROGAN: I will talk to her like a human being. I will try and have a conversation with her.
TRUMP: If she did this kind of an interview with you—I hope she does, because it would be a mess. She'd be laying on the floor, Kamala. You'd be saying, ""Call in the medics.""
ROGAN: I think we'd have a fine conversation. I think I'd be able to talk to her. I wouldn't try to interview her. I'd just try to have a conversation with her and hopefully get to know her as a human being. That was my goal having her on, trying to get her to express herself just as a—I don't know, I don't think these formats are good. I don't think that two people—First of all, I hate the idea of the Presidential debates because I hate the idea of a time limitation on complex ideas. Also, you have to break for—
TRUMP: I think you have to have the debates, though.
ROGAN: Right, but the way they do the debates I think is the wrong way to do it. I think they should have a conversation. I think you and Kamala, you sit across the table with no one in the room, but the two of you, of course you're not gonna shout at each other, of course you're not gonna insult each other.
TRUMP: Well, you may. I mean, it may get a little—They used to do it that way.
ROGAN: Yeah, but hopefully it wouldn't. But that would be the way to do it.
TRUMP: Yeah. They used to do it that way in the old days.
ROGAN: And just to put cameras on you with no, no one interfering with press—with checking whether or not it's factual, especially when it's biased. Because they checked you all those times and they didn't check her with clearly things that were inaccurate. Right? So have two people just have a conversation with each other without a time constraint. And also this idea they caught off the microphone when—
TRUMP: Well, and no crowd. How about no crowd?
ROGAN: No crowd. Crazy too, because you're good at working a crowd.
TRUMP: I would rather have a crowd.
ROGAN: Of course you would, you're good at crowds.
TRUMP: But I would rather, but I had no—So they gave me an alternative. I don't think he wanted the debate.
ROGAN: Why did they want no crowd? What was the argument?
TRUMP: Because I think they thought I wasn't gonna accept it. So I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept. So they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse, and I said, ""I'll do it."" OK? It's like the mob. I'll take it. So they came to me, they said, ""We'll debate Joe Biden."" you know, That thing got tremendous ratings too. That was crazy. But, ""We'll debate Joe Biden, but you can't have a crowd."" They also wanted sitting down. I said, ""That's the only thing—"" I said, ""Look, you gotta, you got to stand up. You can't really sit down."" In the old days, they did sit down a little bit.
ROGAN: He gets tired.
TRUMP: But you got to stand up. And they agreed to it. It was a very tough thing, it almost killed it. They wanted to, they wanted to have desks, we sit. I said, ""I think we should stand up."" And that was the only thing I asked for. I said, ""We gotta stand up."" I, I thought it looked bad for like the public. But they said, ""No crowd, and cut off the mic."" And I said, ""I can live with it. I mean, I can live with it."" And they thought I was gonna reject it. And then they would say, ""He didn't want to debate Sleepy Joe."" That's what they thought was gonna happen.
ROGAN: Well, they tried to say that with you and Kamala as well. They tried to say that you didn't want to debate her as well. But that's—
TRUMP: No, by the way, with her, number one, I'm leading. Number two—you know, They also said it with the primary. So I had like 10, 12 guys in the primary. No stupid guys. I mean, they're governors and they're senators, they're not stupid people. Some are stupid, but not all of them. And all my guys said, ""You have to be in the debate. I said, ""Why? I'm leading by 74 points. The closest guy to me, I'm, I'm like 60 points, 70 points higher. Why would I stand there like an idiot for two hours and let every one of them scream at me? I'm gonna be the focus."" And I said, ""I'm not debating."" And it was a very smart thing because you know, it was, they just killed themselves.
ROGAN: The Republican primaries, yes.
TRUMP: Yeah, the Republican primaries. uh, I like debating. I think, I think you have to debate. But I like debating—
ROGAN: But it has to be fair.
TRUMP: I like debating like the Rosie O'Donnell debate. I like debating when you have a crowd. Remember that Rosie O'Donnell thing?
ROGAN: Yeah. It was very funny. Megyn Kelly.
TRUMP: It was crazy thing. Megyn. That was a hell of a question, man. If I didn't come up with that answer, I was done.
ROGAN: It was a great line.
TRUMP: Well, what it was is, you know, that is, we had 28,000 people. That was the Cleveland Arena where the Cavaliers played. LeBron James, I'm not a big fan of LeBron James, but he is a good basketball player. But, you know, and when I said that, the place went crazy.
ROGAN: Because it's funny.
TRUMP: And she's kept talking. No, she had 10 other—the names—
ROGAN: Yeah, well, Megyn said you said it to other people and you admitted you did. But it was funny. It was a comedic timing moment.
TRUMP: It was fine.
ROGAN: That's what they wanted to avoid.
TRUMP: It was lucky I did, it because she was drown—Oh, she wasn't finished, that question—but she kept talking, but you couldn't hear. To this day, they don't know what she said, but it wasn't positive. So anyway, but we had a good time. I think it's important.
ROGAN: But it's comedic timing, and that's the reason why to have a debate in front of a large audience. And then they probably thought you would stack the deck.
TRUMP: Well, how did I do with the Al Smith dinner?
ROGAN: It was great.
TRUMP: I got very good reviews on that.
ROGAN: That was great. Very funny.
TRUMP: I got good reviews.
ROGAN: Some very funny stuff. The Tim Walz stuff was very funny.
TRUMP: Tim Walz, yeah.
ROGAN: He's funny.
TRUMP: That's a real beauty.
ROGAN: That's a crazy one. She said that she had picked him, and this is one of the questions I want to ask her, when she was sleep-deprived. She said she was suffering from sleep deprivation when she picked him, which is just like, ""Hey, maybe take a nap.""
TRUMP: Okay, look, let's see how it all turns out. I think we're gonna win. I think we're way ahead now. I think we're way ahead. But, but—
ROGAN: Can I bring you back to 2020? Can I bring you back?
TRUMP: But if they lose, I think, I think they're gonna look at two things. They're gonna say they should have had a primary, even if it was a short primary, they shouldn't have picked her. And then she's gonna say, ""I shouldn't have picked this guy.""
ROGAN: She shouldn't have picked that guy.
TRUMP: That guy's a disaster.
ROGAN: Just the lying about Tiananmen Square—
TRUMP: Everything.
ROGAN:—admitting that. Yeah, the military record, assistant coach versus head coach.
TRUMP: But she lied too. She lied too.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: Little thing, so I did McDonald's last week.
ROGAN: I saw that.
TRUMP: And I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar. That's pretty good, right? He said, ""This is the biggest thing we've had in years,"" the hits.
ROGAN: You at McDonald's?
TRUMP: At McDonald's. Did you know that? It was one of the—
ROGAN: It was funny,
TRUMP: Who's a great guy, by the way. But he said, ""This McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google."" It just hit. But the reason I did it, and I actually—You never know about this stuff. I thought it was a throwaway. I didn't think our conversation's a throwaway, but I thought that was. I thought I'd walk in. And that was only to highlight the fact—and I have a friend, he owns like 56 of these McDonald's, and he said, ""Do you want to use one?"" I said, ""Yeah, I love it."" So we went there and the crowd was crazy. you know, They had 28,000 people around the whole thing. Did you see the outside? It was crazy. The cars couldn't get through. Secret Service was not exactly thrilled. Had no idea what the hell—But I went into the place and I did the French fry thing, and it just hit. But that's like in life, sometimes you do—I thought it was like a quick throwaway, we're gonna be there for 15 minutes. Then I said, ""I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here."" She lied about McDonald's. And those—
ROGAN: Is that proven, that she never worked at McDonald's?
TRUMP: 100%. Well, McDonald's has no information. No—she has no information. There's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there. you know, It was a certain place, and he said they never—No, she lied. She's a liar. You know what they do? They'll say like on any one of the questions, take any one, they'll say—It's the exact opposite of what I say. IVF, ""He's against IVF,"" the fertilization. And it's the exact opposite. I was, I came out immediately strongly in favor. And they do ads. I'm against it, it's wrong. uh, On every single topic. And you know, she changed policies on 15. I've never seen a guy change, anybody change on more than one. you know, You can maybe get away with one. Her whole life, fracking, every single thing that she was for, uh, the confiscation of guns. She wants to confiscate, now she's saying everybody should have a gun. In fact, we're gonna get her a MAGA cap. I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap. But she's changed, and I don't think people are buying it. I don't think people are buying it.
ROGAN: Well, some people are buying it because they want to buy it. Because it's blue, no matter who. There's a certain percentage of our population that's gonna vote Democrat no matter what.
TRUMP: That's true.
ROGAN: And they're pressured. There's their community, their ideology, it's left is good, right is evil.
TRUMP: You know what I don't understand? I don't understand why—Okay, you have a wall or you have a—You know, I built 570 miles a wall. Everyone said—I built a lot of wall, exactly the stuff. But you have a border. What I don't understand is who would want people to come into our country from places unknown. Like sometimes they'll say about a fighter, ""From parts unknown,"" right?
ROGAN: Right.
TRUMP: Remember Haystacks Calhoun, he says, ""From parts—
ROGAN: Yeah, the old days.
TRUMP: The old days. Those are the old days. That's even before you. But who would want people to come in, pouring into our country, we don't know anything about 'em?
ROGAN: But I want to ask you this. Why do you think they're doing that?
TRUMP: I think because—
ROGAN: Do you think they're trying to buy votes? Do you think they just want cheap labor? What's the idea?
TRUMP: Okay, it's a couple of theories. They hate our country; they're stupid; or they want to buy votes. It's one of those three things. They wanna—now, they are trying to get people registered who you know, don't even know what the country is.
ROGAN: And they're trying to give people amnesty. People that live here, they're trying to give them a path to citizen.
TRUMP: They want to give them amnesty, they want to give them citizenship. Well, how about what happened—
ROGAN: And if you think about the amount of money that they've given them when they've come here, the food stamps, the benefits that even our poor people aren't getting.
TRUMP: $200 billion, and that's a way low number, that's a way low. you know, It's interesting, New York has always been like sort of always like looking for money. They've spent $100 billion on this stuff. I don't know where they—And they're not getting the money from the federal government, it's crazy. And because the mayor came out and said, ""We can't live like this.""
ROGAN: They investigated him.
TRUMP: He got—by the way I called it, I said, ""He just got himself indicted."" This group is stupid, but they're vicious. They're stupid people, but they're vicious people.
ROGAN: The 2020 elections, you say you have all this evidence that it was rigged. Why haven't you put this evidence in a consumable form?
TRUMP: I did.
ROGAN: In what?
TRUMP: Oh, I did. I have books on it. And by the way, books have been written on it. We have an author named Hemingway who is a great writer, she wrote a book on it. But many books have been written on it. There are books that are—What's happened is judges don't wanna touch it. They would say, ""You don't have standing."" They didn't rule on the merits. They rule—the merits never got there. The judges didn't have what it took to turn over an election.
ROGAN: Let's talk about the potential vulnerabilities for elections and election fraud. One of them is mail-in ballots. The other one is the—if someone can break into voting machines, if someone can hack voting machines, those are two huge ones. And what can be done?
TRUMP: So Elon, Elon Musk, I think he said it public. I hope he did because I wouldn't want it to be the one to—but he's a really smart guy and he's a very good guy with computers, right? You'd say he speaks—
ROGAN: He's one of the smartest people alive.
TRUMP: Anybody that can land that 20 story building, and perfect and boom.
ROGAN: While he's doing Starlink, while he's doing Tesla, while he owns Twitter.
TRUMP: And then he agrees to Starlink and—
ROGAN: And Tweets 100 times a day.
TRUMP: He's an amazing guy, who—He said to me that unless you have paper ballots, it can never be an honest election. That's a big statement.
ROGAN: It's a big statement.
TRUMP: We should go to paper ballots. you know, France did. They went to mail-in voting and it was all messed up.
ROGAN: What can be done?
TRUMP: You know the amazing thing with the machines? So we have the machines, they cost 10 times more. A paper ballot would cost 8%, and they make paper ballots, they're all watermarked and everything else. They're very sophisticated. But if you take a look, paper ballots, 8% the cost, and you're done by nine o'clock in the evening, right? Now we have these sophisticated machine that goes up to heaven, it goes all over the place and down and around, and they say, ""We'll need two weeks to figure out who da hell won the election.
ROGAN: Do you think that's by design?
TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I think it's very crooked. That's my opinion.
ROGAN: You're allowed to have an opinion. What could—let's say you win in November. What can be done to mitigate these problems? What could be done at a, at the level that the President has power?
TRUMP: Well, if I win, that'll be, this will be my last election. But I think I owe it to the country.
ROGAN: It has to be.
TRUMP: But I think I owe it to the country, we have to have fair elections.
ROGAN: So how can you fix that?
TRUMP: Jimmy Carter was in charge of a commission, you know that, many years ago. And they put him and Scoop Jackson, and various Senators, distinguished people that were retired, and they came up with a report. And the report's primary finding was you cannot have mail-in ballots, because if it's a mail-in ballot—you know, I went to the voting booth the last time, whatever it was, and I walked in, in Palm Beach. And I walk in, and they know me. They say, ""Mr. President, could I see your identification?"" ""Yes."" Boom, here's this, here's that. Everything. And then you sit and they watch you sign, and, you really, there's not a lot you can do.
I mean, if you wanted to be dishonest, it's sort of beautiful. If instead of that I'm gonna send them a ballot, it has to go through the postal services. It has to go through a lot of people. They mail you, houses, that the house was demolished and the people have left. And, it, it's so bad. The one thing with Jimmy Carter, he had a very strong commission, it was no mail-in ballots. And we are the only one that does elections this way anymore, they've gotten away from them.
ROGAN: And it ticked up in a big way after COVID, it used to be like soldiers serving overseas.
TRUMP: They used COVID to cheat.
ROGAN: Yeah, well, they used COVID to certainly push this mail- in ballot. Another thing that—
TRUMP: But they used COVID to cheat. And the last election was a little bit of a, you couldn't even get security guys, big strong guys to watch. You know what, you'd call them. They'd call them and they'd say—they were afraid to go out. We were in the middle of COVID. We were in the middle of COVID, right smack in the middle, and they didn't want to die. you know, They didn't want to catch it. In a way, it was like a ghost town, and the whole thing—but mail-in ballots are a bad thing. Bad thing.
ROGAN: That, that certainly is a problem, mail-in ballots are a problem.
TRUMP: But every other country—
ROGAN: The other problem is voter ID.
TRUMP: Voted ID, how about—
ROGAN: Voter ID is the most bizarre argument that I've never seen anybody articulate in a way that's convincing why you don't need voter—
TRUMP: Because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: Well, it doesn't make sense any other way. I've tried to straw man it, or I tried to steal man it rather, I've tried to look at it from a position, like why would you want people to have ID? And a lot of the ideas are just ridiculous, you need an ID to get a driver's license.
TRUMP: Okay, but here's now the next step. Gavin Newscum [sic], one of the worst governors in the world, and I used to, frankly, I used to get along, but I don't get along with him because he's just too—It's just a whole con job. But Gavin Newscum [sic] the other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person, even ask them whether or not they have a voter ID.
ROGAN: Now what could be a charitable reason why anybody would want that?
TRUMP: Because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: But that would be the only thing that makes sense.
TRUMP: But that's taking it to the next level. Now, you have ID. The Democrat National Convention, when they had it the last time. I saw, they had a sign, like a billboard, the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell their boyfriends are, every single, it was—and a big picture, that's for their, they have an ID, a big ID. It was hanging like you were a prisoner. It wa—they had these massive cards, everything. And yet when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay, when you go to a grocery store, you give ID. But for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing. And it should be a sacred thing, no voter ID, because they want to cheat.
ROGAN: Well, it doesn't make sense in any other way. I've tried to look at it.
TRUMP: There's no other way.
ROGAN: There's no argument that anybody's presented that makes any sense why.
TRUMP: You know the funny thing, Joe, the Democrats, the people, they all think you should have it. In other words, you should have voter. If you go to the people, Mrs. Schwartz, Mrs. Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. They say, ""Of course, yeah."" Democrats, they say yes. It's the politicians that don't want it, like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it. Because they want to be able to cheat, because you know what? If they didn't have it, okay, who is gonna vote for somebody that wants open borders? Who's gonna vote for somebody that wants to have uh, men playing in women's sports?
I have never had one person come up to me and say, ""President, you got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports."" Have you ever? It's like I've never been called by a pollster. I told you my little theory on pollsters. I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care. Nobody's ever come up to me and said, ""We want to have men play in women's sports."" And, you know, I had a funny thing at a property I own in California. I have a woman who's a very good athlete and she works there as a manager, and Brian Urlacher, the big uh, Chicago Bears, great player, you know, 10 time all star, I guess Hall of Fame, a great guy. Big strong guy. And she said, ""Oh, he's one of my favorite athletes. Can I have a picture?"" And I took a picture and I sent it. And I noticed she was the size of his leg, his leg was bigger than she was. And I put it out, ""Should men play in women's sport?"" The whole—it was just so ridiculous.
ROGAN: What's one of the most bizarre and polarizing ideas that's promoted by the left?
TRUMP: But who wants it? Now, unless you're gonna cheat in elections, you're never gonna get—Nobody wants it, I don't think anybody wants it. I've never—I've been told everything, some people want this. I don't know of anybody that wants open borders, nobody's ever come up to me and say, ""President, you've got to let the world come into our country."" Now, if they won, so they have 21 million. I think it's much higher than that because you've got a ways, got a ways where they just walk in. They walk in by—And the other thing you have is human traffickers. You have traffickers and the traffic in women, and they're going wild, now. You know where you have to look? The trunk of cars, can you believe it? They put women in trunks, they'll put three women in a trunk. These people are savages. They're horrible. The worst people, the hu—and the kind of money they make on drugs they're almost making on trafficking now.
And the thing that's made it hot is the internet. That's what, you know, you think of it almost as an ancient thing, but it's the internet. But who would want to have these things? Who would want to have—There's so many, the transgender operations, where they're allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn them into a male, to a female without parental consent. Who wants this? Does anybody want this? I've never heard of anyone, and I can go into 10 different things. The only way they get 'em is by no voter ID. You can't have voter ID, they don't wanna, they want to cheat. There's only one reason, because the voter ID is so basic, it's the most basic thing.
ROGAN: It's very basic.
TRUMP: Who would want this? They want it so they can cheat, because their policies are no good. Their poli—I'll tell you, they're very smart when it comes to that, they're very smart. Although they're not smart in terms of uh, politics in a way, because what do they have that people want? They really don't have. They give away a lot of healthcare, a lot of stuff, but for the most part, their policies are terrible. Their policy on military, she's running on a tax hike. She's gonna raise your taxes. You gotta hear this. We are gonna raise your taxes, and the people clap. But who is gonna win with her? All my life I grew up with politicians—lower taxes. She's politic, she's politicking in that we are gonna raise your taxes.
ROGAN: Well, they wanna, the idea is you want to raise the taxes to the highest earners.
TRUMP: I know, but it really doesn't work out.
ROGAN: They think that millionaires and billionaires are not paying their fair share.
TRUMP: I know, but it doesn't work that way.
ROGAN: Well, it's a narrative, and it's a narrative that appeals to people that are not doing well. And they're like, ""Yeah, our problems are that these rich people are not paying taxes.""
TRUMP: Well, the problems are the rich people are gonna leave and they're gonna close up their companies, and then the other people aren't gonna have jobs. You know, that's what happens.
ROGAN: It does happen in other countries.
TRUMP: But, the whole—because you brought it up. I'll tell you what, we just, he's doing a very good job in Virginia, Glen Youngkin, I don't know if you like him, not like him.
ROGAN: I don't know him.
TRUMP: Oh, you don't know him, the governor of Virginia? So, we have a case where they found thousands of illegal ballots. A judge just ruled that they have to be able to vote. Just happened today. Just before I walked in here I heard. A judge just ruled that you have to keep those people in. They're illegal, they're illegal votes. Now, I think they'll be overturned at the next court. One thing I found, because I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit, the system. Because the system, you have to hope that the appellate judges are honest, otherwise we don't have a country anymore. It's very important. But the whole thing with the legal ballots, it's got to be looked at. You gotta have—you have to have voter ID and you have to have additional ID. You have to have an ID that shows that you're a citizen of the country.
ROGAN: I agree.
TRUMP: They don't want that either.
ROGAN: I agree. uh, One of the things that I wanted to talk to you about is the JFK files, and one of the things that you said was that if they showed you what they showed me, this is your quote, ""You wouldn't want people to know it either.""
TRUMP: uh, So I, I opened them up partially. I was met with, from good people. Look, I mean good people. People that were well-meaning, Mike Pompeo was one of them. He's a good person. uh, They called me, they said, ""Sarah would rather have you not."" After, and I did open 'em, but I was asked by some people not to open 'em. There's a Martin Luther King file too, by the way, that they'd like to see. I don't know if you know, but there is that. But, but JFK in particular. So they called me, a lot of good people called me. People that I, that you would find reasonable people, and they asked me not to do it. So I said, ""Well, we'll close it for another time."" But if I win, I'm gonna open them up, I'm just gonna open. Enough times.
ROGAN: Why didn't you open it up the first time though, what was the hesitation?
TRUMP: Addresses, people that are still living, there are people that are affected. uh, And there could be some national security reason that for, that I don't have to necessarily know about, but some very good talented people asked me not to do it. I opened it up, and then they said, ""Would it be possible for us to do that a different day?""
ROGAN: What, how much—much of it did you read into?
TRUMP: uh, I think it's gonna be just fine to open it, let me put it that way. I think it's fine. It's gonna be time. It's a cleansing, you know, it's really a cleansing. So I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it immediately, almost immediately upon entering office.
ROGAN: Well, the thing, when people look at it from the outside, and you sort of imagine what could be a reason why they would not release those files. It would be there's people that were implicated in the assassination.
TRUMP: Well, when there are living people, you generally tend not to want to do it, when people are still living.
ROGAN: Living people that formerly worked for the government.
TRUMP: For the government, and living people that were somehow involved in it. And you tend not to do that. But uh, it's time to open them. uh, I can't tell you whether or not they're gonna find anything of interest. And I did partially open, I think I've opened up 50%, but I was asked not to do it. And I, I thought that was a reasonable ask, but now I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it very soon. There's a lot of interest in it. There's a lot of interest in the people coming from space, you know.
ROGAN: Yes.
TRUMP: And I know you're interested in that too.
ROGAN: Oh, I'm very interested in that. How much did they tell you about that?
TRUMP: A lot.
ROGAN: Really?
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: What'd they tell you? How much can you tell? How's that work? Is it super top secret?
TRUMP: I can tell.
ROGAN: Tell me.
TRUMP: Well, based on Hunter Biden, I can say whatever the hell I want. But, no—but I interviewed a few people. It's never been my thing, I have to be honest. I have never been a believer. I have people that, Area 51 or whatever it is, I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something. Area 51, in Las Vegas—do you know that, right?
ROGAN: Sure, I know what it is.
TRUMP: So, anyway, but it's a big tourist thing. So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them, you'd love to have them in your studio.
ROGAN: I've had a couple in here, Commander David Fravor, I had him in who had that sighting in 2004. Very, very compelling, with visual video evidence, radar evidence. Ryan Graves.
TRUMP: I don't believe his name, but I interviewed jet pilots that uh, were solid people, perfect. I mean, great pilots, great everything. And they said, ""We saw things, Sir, that were, were very strange. Like a round ball, but it wasn't a comet or a meteor, it was something. And it was going four times faster than an F-22,"" which is a very fast plane, you know. And it was round, uh, which is in theory a great shape.
ROGAN: So when you were talking to these people, was this something that you were compelled to have conversations about?
TRUMP: No.
ROGAN: Was this your personal interest?
TRUMP: A little bit. It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question, do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?
ROGAN: What do you think?
TRUMP: There's no reason not to. I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life. you know,
ROGAN: Well, Mars, we've had probes there and rovers, and I don't think there's any life there.
TRUMP: Well, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.
ROGAN: Well, maybe there was life there at one point in time. This is a speculation about Mars, that Mars had an atmosphere at one point in time, a long time ago, that could support life. It also had large bodies of water, but we've had no evidence of even bacterial life that exists on Mars. But the universe is pretty vast.
TRUMP: It's not been a big thing for me. When I looked at what China did to this admin—they would've never done it with me, where they put the balloon up. And a lot of people thought, a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things.
ROGAN: Well, that's a lot of the speculation too, that some of these drones that hover over battleships, that these are Chinese drones and that they're not UFOs.
TRUMP: They could be also.
ROGAN: There's some super sophisticated—
TRUMP: But I did interview, let's say three or four guys, that, and without tremendous interest, if you had them, as I said, you'd love to have them as your children. Solid beautiful people. They said, ""Sir, there's something there.""
ROGAN: There's something there. Yeah, I've talked to quite a few of them.
TRUMP: They're not conspiracy guys.
ROGAN: Well, just the Commander David Fravor thing in 2004 off the coast of San Diego, they clocked that thing going from 50,000 feet above sea level to 50 in a second. They don't know what it is.
TRUMP: That's tough to beat.
ROGAN: Yeah, they saw something in the water, it was hovering over that something that was making a disturbance in the water. They got video evidence of this thing. Two different fighter jets with pilots in them saw it. There's you know, visual evidence, photographic evidence, video evidence, radar evidence, whatever the hell it is, it moves in a way that would turn a human being into Jello if they're inside of it. The G-Force, no one would survive. It's like, what is that? And it doesn't have a heat signature, they don't know what their propulsion system was. But—
TRUMP: When you fly in some of these jets, these pilots have to be in great shape.
ROGAN: Oh yeah, I flew with the Blue Angels once. Yeah, I got to fly. I guess it's an F/A-18.
TRUMP: And those are older machines.
ROGAN: And they're crazy.
TRUMP: When you fly in some of these things, it's amazing.
ROGAN: Oh my God. Yeah, I can imagine.
TRUMP: But you got to be special.
ROGAN: But these things that these people are in encountering are far superior to what we know of. Is it possible that there's some military or government program that you weren't, that they didn't tell you about?
TRUMP: I think, I think I had a great relationship with the military basically, but you know, I didn't like certain people. I would've gotten them out if I thought—if I were—if the election was different, I would've fired you know, all of them quickly. Some, most of them I did fire. Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghanistan, he should have had a lot of firings. you know, If you look at him, he told Israel not to do anything, and at least Israel's not gonna look at it in a bomb the way they would've been. I think if they listened to Biden, they'd be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head right now. He's been wrong about so much. I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong too, because you know, they said, she always said they made the decision together. But uh, Israel didn't follow his advice, and I think it was a, uh, I think—and the Middle East is rapidly changing.
you know, There are Prophets that say the world will come to an end in the Middle East, you know that, right? And we have weapons today that are so scary when you look, I rebuilt them all. And when you look at the weapons we have today, the biggest threat we have in the world today is nuclear weapons. And we have other weapons too that are devastating, but the nuclear weapons, the biggest threat we have in the world today. And that's what—you—I was talking about de-escalation with both China and Russia. I'm telling you, we were gonna de-escalate, they were gonna de-escalate. You got to be careful, it's a little tricky playing with them. Because they say, ""We're gonna do it,"" and they don't do it, maybe. But they understood the curse too, it's a curse. It, uh, China's way behind us, but they'll catch us within five years.
ROGAN: So let's imagine, let's, let's say you win in November. What do you do differently and how do you change this course that it seems we are on for World War III? How do you get us out of Ukraine? How do you stop what's going on in the Middle East? How do you put a stop to this?
TRUMP: Well, it's a very, uh, to me it's an easy question, because I think I can do it easily, but it's a complex question in the sense that the times change, every day changes. uh, Who's winning, who's not winning? I mean, Russia's a war machine, whether you like it or not, it just grinds along, grinds along. You speak to people like Viktor Orban, he'll tell you, it's just a big fat war machine, and that's what's happening. You look at what's happened to Ukraine, if I were there, it would've never happened.
ROGAN: But you, what could you do now, if you get into office in January, what could you do now?
TRUMP: Right now, right now, right now, you would get both of them. I know both very well. And, and again, I cannot, I do not want to tell you for the purpose of looking smart to five people that you know, say, ""Oh, he was great."" Because if I told you exactly what I'd do, I could, I could never make the deal. All I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him, and I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them. And I believe that as President-elect, I would get that war stopped and stopped fast. you know, We have tremendous power in the United States if you know how to use the power. I stopped other wars just by the use of tariffs. I got Macron of France, good guys, like a friend of mine, but he's a wise guy. And he's a person that likes France, and he was gonna tax our companies. And I say, I sent all the smartest guys. I sent Mnuchin, they all failed me. And I said, ""I'll do it myself.""
And I called him, I said, ""Emmanuel, you're taxing American companies. We're not gonna allow you to do that."" ""Oh, Donald, I cannot do—nothing I could do. It's already been passed."" I said, ""Emmanuel, if you do that, I'm gonna put 100% tariff on your wines and champagnes that come in to the United States, and you're gonna regret that you ever did it."" He said, ""Donald, please, that's not fair."" Anyway, within about two minutes he dropped the whole thing, and it was massive amounts of money against American companies. I have to protect American companies.
ROGAN: So why doesn't the Biden Administration do this?
TRUMP: Because they're incompetent, they don't know how to talk. Look, they met in Alaska with uh, the Chinese, and the Chinese lectured them about how badly we treat people. Right? Okay, think of it. You remember that day? It was like in a—they didn't talk to me that way. They never—they respected me. They respected our country. They don't respect our country. They don't respect Biden, they don't respect her. They're dreaming about her because she's incompetent. She's not a smart person. Look, she can't put two sentences together. She talks, I watched her two nights. I watched her last night too, it was the same thing. She's not a smart person. These guys are very smart and they're very streetwise, and they're very tricky and evil and dangerous. And if she becomes the President of the United States, which I can't believe can happen, I don't think this country is gonna make it. I don't think we'll ever be—I think, I think just really bad things will happen to our country.
And you know what? I look at the outside forces and I say they can all be handled, because we have a pot of gold, but we're not gonna have that pot of gold to play with anymore. you know, It's a great negotiating thing. I told you, I knocked out this massive car company, gonna take all of our car business from Detroit. I knocked it out just by my rhetoric, rhetorically I said, ""They'll never sell a car in here. I'll put tariffs. I don't care they're 2000%, they're never gonna build that plant.""
ROGAN: Is it possible to apply that same thing to the electronics that we use?
TRUMP: Yeah.
ROGAN: One of the things that disturbs me greatly is that all of our phones are made overseas, and then some of our phones are made in places like—
TRUMP: And the chips.
ROGAN: Yes, and the chips. And some of our phones are made in places like Foxconn, where they have nets around the building to keep people from jumping off the roof because they have so many suicides. LIKE Wouldn't it be better to have an American made iPhone, where you know people are paid good wages, they have health insurance, they're taken care of, they can live a good life. Where you're not buying a piece of electronics that's cheaper because someone has to suffer horrible, in a horrible way that's not even legal in the United States. It's not even legal to have them work that way in the United States, so they get these people to build them overseas.
TRUMP: You do it, but let me just say, that chip deal is so bad. We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they're not gonna give us the good companies anyway. All you had to do is charge them tariffs. If you would've put a tariff on the chips coming in, you would've been able to, just like the auto companies, no different. More sophisticated, but no different. you know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect and they want protection, they don't pay us money for the protection, you know. The mob makes you pay money, right? But with these countries that we protect, I got hundreds of billions of dollars from NATO countries that were never paying us. And my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, who just left as the Director General, as a Secretary General, good guy.
He said, ""Bush came, he made a speech. Obama came, he made a speech. Trump came, he said, you guys aren't paying. You gotta pay."" And they said, ""Will you protect us from Russia if we don't?"" I said, ""No, you got to pay. If you don't pay—"" Billions of dollars came in to NATO. When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way. You didn't have to put up 10 cents, you could have done it with a series of tariffs. In other words, you tariff it so high that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing. In other words, Joe, you put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say, ""You don't have to pay the tariff, all you have to do is build your plant in the United States."" We didn't have to give them the money to build the plant, besides that, they're very rich companies. These chip companies, they stole. They stole 95% of our business, it's in Taiwan right now.
They do a great job, but that's only because we have stupid politicians. We lost the chip business, and now we think we're gonna pay. You can't build it that way. You have to make them spend their money in the United States, and those plants would open up all over. And they'll fund them, we don't have to put up 10 cents. I am in the process of making a huge speech in about a little while, and you and I, how long have we been talking?
ROGAN: A long time.
TRUMP: Let's go.
ROGAN: Probably like three hours.
TRUMP: I got to make a speech, but we'll do it again. I want to do it again with you. You are something.
ROGAN: Thank very much.
TRUMP: I said, ""How long will this last?"" Anywhere from an hour to three or four hours.
ROGAN: How long we do, Jamie? Three hours.
TRUMP: Good. Well, we'll do it again. I thought it was great.
ROGAN: I think it was great, it was a lot of fun.
TRUMP: You are a fascinating guy and you've done a great job.
ROGAN: Thank you very much.
TRUMP: I'm a big fan, and thank you very much. It's been an honor.
ROGAN: It's been an honor to have you as well.
TRUMP: I'm gonna make a great speech and I'm gonna say, and if I'm a little off tonight, I'm gonna blame you.
ROGAN: Blame me. Go ahead, blame me.
TRUMP: I'm gonna say, ""I spoke to this guy for three hours."" Anyway, it's a great honor to be with you.
ROGAN: Thank you, sir.
TRUMP: Thank you.
ROGAN: Good luck to you.
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
ROGAN: Thank you.
TRUMP: Appreciate it.
ROGAN: All right. Bye everybody.
